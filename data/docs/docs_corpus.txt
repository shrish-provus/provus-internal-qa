What is Provus?
Provus is an intelligent services quoting platform designed specifically for services organizations. Unlike product-based CPQ tools that focus on products, Provus is tailored to address the complexities of services-based quoting.
It enables organizations to efficiently create, manage, and deliver accurate quotes for services such as consulting, professional services, and managed services. By streamlining the services quoting process, Provus helps improve accuracy, reduce cycle times, and drive higher customer satisfaction.
Overview
Provus provides configuration, pricing, and quoting (CPQ) solutions for companies offering services, including:
Consulting Services
: Firms such as Deloitte and KPMG that sell consulting expertise to clients.
Professional Services
: Internal organizations within companies that deliver services like implementation, onboarding, and other project-based engagements focused on specific initiatives.
Managed Services
: Companies that outsource ongoing processes and functions to external providers or consultants who manage them on their behalf.
Provus Services CPQ – How is it different from standard CPQ products?
Traditional CPQ tools are primarily designed for product-centric companies where the quoting process is relatively straightforward. However, services quoting is inherently more complex, involving variable pricing models, resource allocations, milestone billing, and custom project scopes.
Provus Services CPQ is built to handle these complexities. It supports services-specific workflows such as effort estimation, rate card management, dynamic pricing based on skills, locations, or roles, and complex approvals based on margin thresholds or resource plans. This makes it uniquely suited to services organizations where flexibility and accuracy are critical.
What business problems are we solving?
Many services organizations today struggle with quoting processes that rely heavily on spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected systems. This leads to common issues such as:
Inconsistent pricing and approvals.
Manual errors in quotes and estimates.
Lack of visibility into pipeline and margin health.
Slow quote turnaround times, leading to delays in deal closure.
Provus addresses these gaps by providing an integrated, automated platform that improves collaboration, ensures pricing governance, and enhances the overall accuracy and efficiency of the quoting process.
Benefits of Provus – Why should you use Provus?
Provus delivers several key benefits for services organizations:
Faster quote turnaround
by automating complex quoting steps.
Improved accuracy
in pricing, effort estimation, and resource allocation.
Enhanced collaboration
between sales, delivery, and finance teams.
Better governance and compliance
through configurable approval workflows and audit trails.
Increased win rates and profitability
by providing flexible, accurate, and customer-centric quotes.
Revenue Maximization
- Prevent leaving money on the table by strategically pulling forward revenue and offering the right services at the right price.
Margin Optimization
- Prevent margin leakage through granular visibility and control when negotiating complex multi-year service deals.
These benefits help services organizations close deals more quickly while protecting margins and enhancing the customer experience.
Connected Services Outcomes
At Provus, we believe that CFOs/CXOs do not need to just mitigate risk … but can take an offensive approach that maximizes growth and returns for your organization by effectively controlling and managing this heightened risk.
Provus needs to enable you to control risk around margin erosion and operational inefficiencies. We need to help you manage uncertainties like revenue shortfalls. And we need to help you avoid silos and fragmented decision-making because that puts you and the business in a sub-optimal position.
The economics and collaboration in support of Selling Services, Services Delivery, and Customer Service must be interconnected more fluidly and integrated.
This is why Provus champions an approach we call the Connected Services Outcomes. This strategy not only mitigates risk but also creates opportunities for growth by streamlining and aligning the services quoting process with business goals. Connected Services Outcomes empowers organizations to:
Control Known Risks
: Implement controls over root causes like rogue discounting, unanticipated expenses, and scope creep to prevent margin erosion and revenue leakage.
Manage Uncertainties
: Leverage real-time, accessible data to make informed, confident decisions even in unpredictable circumstances.
By shifting from a fragmented to a connected approach, Provus enables organizations to address operational inefficiencies that arise from delayed approvals, siloed scoping processes, and inconsistent data across departments.
Again, the foundation for all of this is a Connected Services Outcomes strategy.
Key Value Drivers
Provus empowers your business to achieve Connected Service Outcomes by leveraging real-time data and analytics. This allows for the creation of precise, dynamic quotes that accurately reflect actual service costs and anticipated results.
Our solution seamlessly integrates your services quoting with your front-end CRM and back-end PSA systems. By connecting data on past performance, resource availability, and customer requirements, Provus ensures your quotes are:
Accurate and aligned with your profit goals.
Competitive in today's fast-paced market.
Predictive of margin outcomes, helping you realize your financial objectives.
Within Provus, you can easily create service proposals, model pricing, and manage approvals based on predefined thresholds. Provus delivers:
A seamless and unified workflow for your users.
Approval processes that ensure margins, discounts, and pricing adhere to company standards.
Clear visibility into project execution.
This visibility into project execution is crucial for controlling risks and managing uncertainty. While projects typically start with certain expected margins and revenue, changes in timelines, resources, and other unforeseen factors often impact project outcomes, leading to:
Margin erosion
Revenue shortfall
Fragmented decision-making
Provus addresses these challenges by providing a connected experience from opportunity creation through quoting and project execution. This ensures that your margin and revenue strategies remain aligned from the very beginning (opportunities) to the very end (completed project) for all stakeholders.
Standard quoting process flow (generic flow)
The standard quoting process typically involves several key steps, ensuring that opportunities are thoroughly vetted, services clearly defined, and proposals meticulously crafted before reaching the client. Here's a breakdown:
Lead and Opportunity Generation
: It all starts with identifying and qualifying a potential opportunity within your CRM system. This initial step sets the stage for the entire quoting journey.
Service Quote Creation
: Once an opportunity is clear, the next step is to generate a quote that precisely outlines the customer's needs and the delivery timeline.
Effort Estimation
: This crucial phase involves estimating the effort required to deliver the service and clearly specifying the deliverables.
Resource Allocation
: After estimating the effort, you'll allocate the necessary human resources to the specific tasks, essentially defining "who" will do the work.
Pricing and Discounts
: Here, you'll apply various financial considerations, including discounts, markups, overrides, Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA), contingencies, and a payment schedule.
Scenario Modeling & Collaboration
: Before finalizing, it's smart to explore different quote options, discount structures, and estimations. This collaborative phase allows for flexibility and optimization.
Approvals
: Quotes then go through an internal approval process, routed based on predefined thresholds to ensure alignment with company policies.
Quote Generation
: Once approved, a formal quote document is created, ready for presentation.
Customer Review and Negotiation
: The quote is shared with the customer, allowing for review and any necessary adjustments through negotiation.
Signed Contract
: The final step involves delivering the finalized proposal for signature, culminating in a signed contract.
Provus helps streamline and automate each of these steps, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and a seamless experience for both internal teams and customers.
Core Capabilities for Services Quoting
Quote Scoping
Scoping helps identify the services required for the quote and, using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), breaks them down into manageable components.
The WBS is a structured hierarchy that organizes work into smaller parts:
Service
– The main type of work (top level)
Activity Group
– Clusters of related activities
Activity
– Specific processes that require resources
Task
– The smallest unit of work where effort is allocated
Effort Estimation
Effort estimation determines the time and resources needed to complete each task, supporting accurate planning, budgeting, and resource assignment.
Effort details can be viewed and managed on the Effort tab within the Quote or Estimate. It involves three key components:
Estimation Inputs
Effort can be calculated using fixed values or formulas. These formulas can incorporate inputs such as the number of users, training sessions, or license requirements, enabling more precise, project-specific estimates.
Task Duration Calculation
Estimation managers can use a formula builder to define how task durations are calculated, leveraging the defined estimation inputs.
Task Effort Adjustments
Effort estimates can be fine-tuned by adding or reducing effort for individual tasks, allowing for more accurate planning and resource optimization.
Resource Allocation
Resource allocation involves assigning resources to tasks to ensure balanced workload distribution.
Single or Multiple Resources per Task
Tasks can be assigned to one or multiple resources. For example, a 90-hour task could be split as:
60% to a Business Analyst
20% each to a Product Manager and QA Lead
The total must always equal the task’s total effort.
Location Mix
Resources can be allocated from various locations (onsite, offshore, nearshore) to balance cost and availability—for example, a U.S.-based lead working alongside an offshore developer.
Skill Mix
Tasks often require multiple skill sets. Roles such as Developer, Business Analyst, or Tester can be assigned to ensure the right expertise is applied, improving quality, efficiency, and cost control.
Estimation Templates
Create any quote with proven structures tailored for repeatable services. Each template comes pre-loaded with a full Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), effort guidelines, and a flexible resource mix. Customize them with built-in variables, formulas, and parameters to automate calculations and maintain consistency across teams. Create accurate, consistent quotes with the right resources in minutes, not hours.
Price / Margin Management
Adjust prices during the quote process to meet customer expectations or internal margin targets by:
Flexible Negotiation & Adjustment
:
Quote-Level Discounts
: Apply flat discounts across the entire quote.
Total Amount Adjustment
: Easily round or adjust the final quote total.
Location Discounts
: Apply region-specific discounts.
Volume Discounts
: Utilize effort- or revenue-based tiers for discount application.
Base Price/Cost Override
: Override default pri
ces or costs from the rate card.
Resource-Specific Discounts / Markups
: Customize pricing at the individual resource level.
Transparent Pricing Summaries
: View detailed breakdowns by role, location, time period, or service.
Add-ons & Contingencies
Add-ons
: Easily include optional services or components.
Contingency
: Incorporate a buffer for unforeseen costs as a markup.
Billing Schedule / Milestones
Define milestones based on dates, tasks, or other project achievements. Track billing progress using fields like Activity Name, Date, Amount, and Alignment, ensuring both delivery and financial progress are monitored.
What-If Scenario Modeling
Model multiple scenarios within a single quote. Test variations for pricing models, locations, and resource mixes. Submit multiple versions for internal approval and customer review.
Quote Approvals
Provus leverages standard Salesforce approval workflows. Quotes move through statuses like Pending Approval, Approved, or Rejected. Once submitted, quotes are locked for editing. Email notifications alert approvers, and rejections include clear reasons and comments. Approval-only users are managed via a ReadOnlyUser permission set.
Rate Cards
Global Multi-Currency Rate Cards
: Set prices for international deals in multiple currencies.
Customer-Specific Rate Cards
: Maintain custom-negotiated pricing for each client.
Resource & Add-on Item Rate Cards
: Ensure consistent pricing for all services and extras.
COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment)
Define annual COLA rates.
Apply automatically at the quote or resource level.
In summary, Provus empowers services organizations with a purpose-built platform that transforms complex quoting into a streamlined, connected, and data-driven process. By aligning sales, delivery, and finance through its Connected Services Outcomes framework, Provus reduces risk, improves efficiency, and unlocks new opportunities for revenue growth and margin optimization, ensuring every quote leads to a successful, customer-centric outcome.

Introduction
In software development, ensuring top-notch quality and functionality remains a primary objective. Automated testing is a process of using automation tools to test software applications and mobile apps efficiently.
Automation Framework Overview
Automation testing frameworks streamline the testing process and elevate overall efficiency.
Among the array of frameworks, Cucumber and Gherkin distinguish themselves with their clarity and user-friendly nature, particularly in crafting automated tests using the behavior-driven development (BDD) approach.
Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development methodology that focuses on collaboration and communication among team members—such as developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, product owners, and business stakeholders—to improve the software development process.
BDD aims to ensure that the development team understands the expected behavior of the software from the user's perspective. It encourages the use of common, plain-language descriptions of the software's behavior, expressed as scenarios or examples, to drive the development process.
Automation Framework Components
What is Cucumber
Cucumber is a testing tool used in software development for behavior-driven development (BDD). It allows for the creation of test cases written in a language called Gherkin, which is human-readable and easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand. Cucumber helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members by enabling collaboration through the creation of executable specifications.
What is Gherkin
Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. Gherkin is used for writing automated tests in the context of software development. It allows developers to write tests in a natural language format that non-technical stakeholders easily understand.
A Gherkin scenario is a high-level description of a particular behavior or feature of the software being tested and it typically follows this structure:
Feature
:
<
short description
of
the feature being tested
>
Scenario
:
<
short description
of
the scenario being tested
>
Given
<
some initial context or state
>
When
<
some action is performed
>
Then
<
some outcome or result is expected
>

What is the Screenplay Design Pattern
Screenplay design is a pattern used in test automation that focuses on creating more maintainable and readable automated tests by emphasizing the roles involved in interacting with a system.
In the screenplay pattern, tests are written in terms of "actors," "tasks," and "interactions" rather than focusing solely on page elements and their interactions.
Screenplay Design
Here is an overview of its key components:
Actors
: Actors represent the users or personas interacting with the system. Each actor encapsulates their capabilities, permissions, and interactions with the application.
Abilities
: Abilities are the skills or capabilities of an actor. For instance, an actor might have the ability to navigate web pages, interact with forms, or perform specific actions within the application.
Tasks
: Tasks represent the high-level actions or goals that an actor wants to achieve in the system. These tasks are defined independently of the implementation details and encapsulate the user's intentions.
Interactions
: Interactions are the specific actions performed by an actor to accomplish a task. These interactions are designed to be reusable and independent of the test framework, focusing on what the user does rather than how the system is implemented.
For more information, refer to
Screenplay Pattern | Serenity/JS (serenity-js.org)
Step Definition
A Step Definition is a Javascript method with an expression that links it to one or more Gherkin steps. When Cucumber executes a Gherkin step in a scenario, it will look for a matching step definition to execute.
In the context of test automation frameworks like Cucumber, which utilize Gherkin syntax for behavior-driven development (BDD), the combination of screenplay design and step definitions can create a powerful and maintainable testing structure.
When combining screenplay design with step definitions, you can implement the interactions and tasks defined in the screenplay pattern within these step definitions.
To illustrate how this works, see the following Gherkin Scenario:

Interaction
To improve the organization and maintainability of your code, you can encapsulate each small piece of functionality as its own object, each with a consistent interface. Each object has a single method that takes a single input (the actor interacting with the system) and allows you to execute that action within your app. This helps keep the code for interacting with your app organized and avoids the need for scattered helper methods or page objects.
Below are some commonly used interactions:
Insert
: Handles the insertion of a record into the database.
Enter
: Inputs text into a specific field within a browser.
Click
: Facilitates clicking on any element within the application.
Wait
: Delays the test system for a specified time or until a designated element becomes visible.
PauseRunner
: Pauses playwright, opening a debug UI for comprehensive testing purposes.
Writing Clear and Concise Steps
You should write simple and easy to understand steps. Avoid the use of complex language or unnecessary details.
Provus Example
: Create a Scenario from a Quote
Wrong
way of writing gherkin steps:
Scenario
:
Create Scenario from a quote
    Given
I
visited the last created quote
    When
I
click on the
"Create Scenario"
button
    Then
I
enter
"Scenario 1"
in
the scenario name
    And
I
click the create button
    Then
I
should be taken to the scenario quote page
    Then the quote header should show
'Description'
as
'Scenario 1'
JavaScript
Copy
The above example is overly verbose and does not flow very well from step to step. The order and mix of When, And, and Then steps don’t seem to follow any pattern.
Right
way of writing gherkin steps:
Consolidate the steps into a single user interaction (When step) and a single assertion (Then step) to provide concise context and expected results.
Scenario
:
Create Scenario from a quote
    Given
I
visited the last created quote
    When
I
create a scenario named
"Scenario 1"
Then the quote header should show
'Description'
as
'Scenario 1'
JavaScript

JavaScript
Copy
Task
In Gherkin scenarios, "tasks" represent sequences of interactions working together to accomplish a specific goal or behavior.
By breaking your automation into smaller interactions, you can assemble these individual actions into larger sequences known as "Tasks," tailored to address specific challenges within your domain.
For instance, consider the Gherkin scenario for generating a quote.
To create such a scenario, you typically undertake the following steps:
Select "Create Scenario."
Input a value.
Click "Create."
However, you can consolidate these actions into a single readable task that handles the expected list of interactions on the page:
// scenario.steps.ts
When
(
'{actor} create a scenario named {string}'
,
async
(
actor
:
Actor
,
scenarioName
:
string
)
=>
return
actor

attemptsTo
(
CreateScenario
.

)
;
JavaScript
Copy
and
CreateScenario
would look like the following:
// scenario.tasks.ts
const
CreateScenario
=
{
withName

(
scenarioName

createActorTask

Running Functional Tests Locally
Before you run the tests locally, perform the automation setup with IntelliJ.
For more information, refer to
Automation setup with Intellij (notion.so)
The current repository has `tests` directory. You will need to run `npm install` in that specific directory to install all related dependencies for our functional tests.
Depending on the org you have will determine which commands you will use to run the functional tests (e.g., `npm run test` from `quoting/tests` )
⚠️ If you are on a new network, you will most likely not be able to run the tests until you add your current IP address to the trusted IP ranges list again. Follow the steps here:
Onboarding Setup (README) (notion.so)
If you have a scratch org or managed org, you can run one of the following commands:
npm run test:managed
Runs the functional tests synchronously in the browser
npm run test:managed:headless
Runs the functional tests async in 6 threads
npm run test:managed:only
Runs the functional tests tagged with `@only`
npm run test:managed:debug
Runs the functional tests and will pause if there is `PauseRunner`
npm run test:managed:headless:highlatency
Runs the functional tests async. If you are in India, chances are the latency is high and you will run into lot of timeout issues, this command should help
Otherwise you can run one of the following commands:
npm run test
Runs the functional tests synchronously in the browser
npm run test:headless
Runs the functional tests async in 6 threads
npm run test:only
Runs the functional tests tagged with `@only`
There is currently not a debug mode command setup, but one can be added in the package.json as follows:
"test:debug": "PWDEBUG=1 cucumber-js --retry ${RETRIES:=0} $TEST_FILES”
Debugging Functional Tests
If you import `PauseRunner` from the `interactions/debug` directory, you can use that in your steps or tasks while running the tests in debug mode. When you run the test in debug mode with `PauseRunner`, the playwright inspector opens.
Using the PauseRunner in your steps or tasks example:
import
PauseRunner
from
'../features/tasks/interactions/debug'
;
actor
.

Configurable Component Settings
Design Diagram
Settings Custom Metadata
The custom metadata type that we use for controlling components is called
Provus Component Configuration
. These are not dynamic — we determine which components can be interacted with, and what fields/inputs/etc. can change. Please refer to for a list -
Supported Components & Fields
Provus Component Settings Fields
Component__c
Picklist - the component name
CustomPermissionName__c
Optional. Checks the permission name here against the context user to see if this setting applies to them.
DefaultJson__c
Read-only. Upgradeable. Contains the default state of the JSON.
Json__c
Subscriber editable. Contains the override JSON.
Settings Hierarchy
The settings hierarchy will govern each component’s rules. These are applied in the following order:
Default Settings (provided by Provus)
Override Settings (user-created)
Custom Permission Settings (user-created)
The
default settings
will always be applied. To supersede the default settings, users must create an
override settings
metadata record. Finally, the user can specify a
custom permission
setting
inside the override settings file, which takes the highest priority.
⚠️ Each rule defined on a level will automatically overwrite the same rule on a previous level. If a rule is not specified on a higher level, we refer to the previous level, and then the default level.
The following describes what each level does & how it can be used.
Default Level Settings
Contains the default state of the component and shows which settings are available to override. Users should use the default settings JSON as a reference point for their settings.
Cannot be edited by the subscriber.
Example of a default JSON record.
Component Configuration Name:
QuoteConfigurator_default
JSON:
{
   "version":"1.0",
   "grids":{
      "quoteGrid":{
         "rows":{
            "totalPersonUnits":{
               "visible":true
            },
            "totalAmount":{
               "visible":true
            }
         },
         "columnGroups":{
            "periods":{
               "visible":true
            },
            "periodGroups":{
               "visible":true
            }
         }
      }
   }
}

Copy
Override Level Settings
Contains settings that override the default settings.
Component Configuration Name:
QuoteConfigurator
JSON:
{
   "version":"1.0",
   "grids":{
      "quoteGrid":{
         "rows":{
            "totalPersonUnits":{
               "visible":false
            },
            "totalAmount":{
               "visible":false
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
Plain text
Copy
Custom Permission Level Settings
Contains settings that precede both the override and default settings. For these settings to apply, the user must also be assigned to a matching custom permission.
Example of a custom permission level JSON:
Component Configuration Name:
hideColumnGroups
JSON:
{
   "version":"1.0",
   "grids":{
      "quoteGrid":{
         "columnGroups":{
            "periods":{
               "visible":false
            },
            "periodGroups":{
               "visible":false
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
Plain text
Copy
In this example, if the user does not have a custom permission called
hideColumnGroups
assigned to them, then this permission will
not
be applied.
Using the above settings as an example, if all three settings are applied, then the resulting final JSON would effectively be rendered as the following:
Final Component Settings JSON
{
   "version":"1.0",
   "grids":{
      "quoteGrid":{
         "rows":{
            "totalPersonUnits":{
               "visible":false
            },
            "totalAmount":{
               "visible":false
            }
         },
         "columnGroups":{
            "periods":{
               "visible":false
            },
            "periodGroups":{
               "visible":false
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
Plain text
Copy
Settings JSON Structure
Each setting will be defined with a field containing a JSON structure that represents rules that govern the component.

Reading data from the feature file and using it in the test
Feature File
A feature file in Cucumber is a plain text file with a “.feature” extension. Feature file contains scenarios written in Gherkin. Gherkin syntax in the feature file includes keywords like Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, and But. These keywords help in structuring the tests into understandable scenarios, outlining the steps taken and expected outcomes.

Data Table
In test automation, data tables represent tabular data and often contain test input values (data setup), expected outcomes (assertions), or other relevant data needed to perform and verify automated test cases. They enable testers to execute tests with different datasets without modifying the test script itself, enhancing the scalability and flexibility of automated testing processes.
In the example below, the feature is to create a quote from an estimate.
The data table 1 contains the initial estimate information, including Activity Groups (e.g., Section 1, Section 2), Resources, Tasks, and Task Durations. This table serves as the input dataset for creating a quote.
When you create a quote from this estimate using the provided dataset, the resulting quote allocation is displayed in data table 2. This table mirrors the quote grid format, resembling a tabular structure where various assertions or allocations are organized systematically for analysis and validation purposes. It helps compare the expected quote allocations against the actual outcomes derived from the estimation process.
Another way to use a Data Table
:
In the following data table, we are not verifying the allocations, but the true data table. The data table is used to validate the accuracy of the Resources Summary page, which typically consists of a two-column structure containing specific information. The objective here is not to verify allocations but rather to validate the content of the physical table against expected data.
For more information on data tables, refer to
cucumber-js/docs/support_files/data_table_interface.md at main · cucumber/cucumber-js (github.com)
Scenario Data Table
The concept of a data table is specific to Cucumber. Data Tables serve the purpose of transmitting a list of values to a step definition. When steps contain a data table, they receive an object equipped with methods to access the data. At Provus, data tables are exclusively employed for representing tabular data, and their usage concludes at the step definition.
To avoid hard dependency on data tables, we refrain from passing them to a task. Instead, we use a utility known as the "Scenario Data table." This utility facilitates the conversion of data tables into consumable data within the step definition. Such an approach proves advantageous if Provus decides to transition to a different BDD software. In such a scenario, the modification required would be limited to the scenario data table utility or class, rather than altering all tasks and scenarios.

Scenario Outline
A scenario typically follows a structure known as "Arrange-Act-Assert" or "Given-When-Then".
A scenario outline usually includes placeholders (known as scenario outline placeholders or data placeholders) in the test steps, which are replaced with actual values during test execution. This allows for the repetition of the same test steps with different data, making it easier to cover multiple scenarios without rewriting the entire test for each variation.
A scenario outline typically includes sections for Given, When, and Then. Additionally, it incorporates an Examples table, detailing the input data and the corresponding expected output.
For more information, refer to
Gherkin Reference - Cucumber Documentation
Scenario Outline example
:
In the example below, we are testing different formulas and expecting different estimated durations.
Given is an estimate template linked to a specific dataset. When you create an estimate from this template, the formula used to compute the estimated duration dynamically alters depending on the provided input.
The steps use <> delimited parameters that reference headers in the examples table. Cucumber will replace these parameters with values from the table before it tries to match the step against a step definition.
In the above example, the Formula column has 2 constant values 100 and 50, and a variable. The <Standard Parameter Formula> variable refers to the Standard Parameter Formula header in the Examples table.
There are two scenarios in the above scenario outline.
Scenario 1
:
During runtime, the variable <Standard Parameter Formula> is assigned the value "($1_Analysis + $2_Solutioning) * 0.05" extracted from the "Standard Parameter Formula" column within the examples table.
Scenario 2
:
During runtime, the variable <Standard Parameter Formula> is assigned the value "($1_1_Requirement_Workshops + $2_1_Design_Discussions) * 0.05" extracted from the "Standard Parameter Formula" column within the examples table.
Selectors/Locators
Provus screenplay pattern follows the POM, with a screenplay representing quotes or estimates as pages. Each quote or estimate is treated as a separate page or entity, and we have corresponding classes or modules for each in the automation framework.
Page Object Model (POM)
: POM is a design pattern used in test automation to create an object repository for web UI elements. It separates the test code from the UI code by creating a class or file for each web page. These classes or files contain locators (selectors) for elements on the page and methods to interact with those elements.
Selectors
: Within the tasks folder, there is a view-models subfolder that contains the selectors for elements on the quote/estimate pages. These selectors include attributes or identifiers (such as IDs, classes, XPaths, etc.) used to locate and interact with specific elements on the page.
To interact with elements on the quote or estimate page, you can access the appropriate view-model for that page. Inside the view-model, you have methods or properties that encapsulate the locators/selectors for different elements.
Consider the following example:
Example 1
:
Example 2
:
In this example, we have a table that has 2 columns Service and Service Category.
We want to locate a particular row in the table based on a specific value of service and service category.
The locator here is segregated into 2, for reusability purposes.
The locator rowContainingValues starts with the table body and locates the row (tr) which has a specific value of service in its <th> and another specific value of serviceCategory in its <td>.
Here the parameters firstText refers to the value of the column
Service
and the second parameter secondText refers to the value of the column
Service Category
.
.first() is used to locate the first matching row of this combination.
Example 2 Illustration:
Example 3
:
In this example, suppose you want to locate the input field Estimate template description.
So the locator starts by navigating to the parent (lightning-input) by filtering the parent which has a label (Estimate template description) and an input box (input).
Example 3 Illustration:
Example 4:
In this example, you want to click on the
Save
button in the footer of the Estimate template task parameter dialog. So, you can use the component of the Estimate template task parameter dialog first and in order to reach the Save button, you have to traverse to the grandparent (hence locator(‘..’) is written twice) and navigate to the active footer via its attribute data-aura-class and reach to the button.
Example 4 Illustration:
Logging and Reporting Mechanism
When you run a scenario, multiple report files are generated, including JSON and HTML formats. These reports capture essential information about the execution of the scenario, aiding in analysis and debugging.
After you run a scenario, two folders are created in the background -
Results
and
Traces
. The Results folder contains all the reports generated in different formats and the Traces folder contains two sub-folders - Fail and Success. These sub-folders contain zip files for the success and failure tests.
You can open the HTML report in the finder to see all the details of the test run. Similarly, you can navigate to go/trace which opens the
https://trace.playwright.dev/
environment, and upload the zip file for detailed analysis.
Traces are frame-by-frame representations of what happens during an automated test. Traces record various information such as console outputs, network activity, and interactions with the application under test. Traces can be beneficial for detailed debugging, especially in scenarios where a test fails. Traces provide a millisecond-by-millisecond breakdown of the test execution, allowing developers to pinpoint issues with specific actions or verifications.

Traces Analysis for CI Illustration:
Framework Design for API Support
You can use APIs within the Salesforce framework instead of relying on Salesforce UIs for record-level modifications due to version disparities during releases. There is a concept of interactions and the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern within a screenplay framework. Actors, interactions, and memory work together, allowing actors to recall the last record created.

How feature flag test execution works
Feature flags serve to control functionality in a product from both a customer-facing and development perspective. They are used to progressively roll out features, allowing for continuous development and controlled releases. There are different types of feature flags, including data features and product settings. An example of a feature flag related to a beta feature is the "push upgrade flag." Feature flags are typically disabled by default to avoid impacting automation processes. Standard automation are run to verify functionality without feature flags, and a specific "feature flag test" is introduced, which runs tests for features with flags enabled.
Special permissions are required to access and control beta features, regulated through a license management app. Implementing feature flags in the code involves a specific directory structure with folders for feature flags and custom permissions. Creating a feature flag is a simple process of copying and pasting, requiring an API name and label. The automation framework executes tests in the context of each feature flag during the CI pipeline.

Continuous Integration with Woodpecker (WP)
In any scenario involving Continuous Integration (CI), the primary objective is to facilitate the seamless and continuous integration and delivery of software within teams and across developers. Essentially, CI serves as the environment where we execute build and test processes to ensure the quality of a committed code. Our chosen platform for this purpose is a software known as Woodpecker.
Woodpecker, being an open-source solution, provides transparency and invites users to explore its documentation for a comprehensive understanding. In previous iterations, Provus utilized Circle CI and GitHub Actions. Woodpecker, as an on-premise version, offers greater flexibility and cost predictability compared to Circle CI. While it may lack some enterprise-specific features, Woodpecker essentially encompasses all the functionalities one would expect from a CI platform.
One notable advantage of Woodpecker is its open-source nature, allowing you to enhance and customize functionalities as needed. Unlike relying on third-party releases, Woodpecker empowers you to build on the platform independently.
Configuring Woodpecker
Woodpecker is a simple yet powerful CI/CD engine with great extensibility. It focuses on executing pipelines inside containers. The functionality of Woodpecker, a tool similar to Jenkins, uses YAML configurations to define pipeline steps. Woodpecker operates on the concepts of pipelines, workflows, and steps. Pipelines are defined in a folder named ".woodpecker" within the project. Workflows, consisting of steps, are executed based on events like pull requests or branch deletion. The overall process involves defining events, setting up workflows, and specifying steps with corresponding configurations and commands.

Frequently Asked Questions
Question:
How do I determine the increase in the COLA cost? Is there a place on the quote where we can track the increase in cost?
Answer:
To determine the increase in the COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) cost, follow these steps:
Navigate to the relevant quote.
Click on the
Quoted Amount
field hyperlink on the quote. This will display the breakdown of the quote items.
In the breakdown, look for the field called
Total Cost
. This field will show the increase in the COLA cost.
By reviewing the Total Cost field, you can track the increase in cost due to the COLA rate adjustment.

Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive coverage of all the globally available APIs within the Provus package. It also serves as a reference for tracking API deprecations used for demo purposes.
The primary entry point for all APIs is the
invoke
method. Depending on the specific API being called, you may need to perform type casting to its respective data type.
String
apiName
=
""
;
Map
<

response
=

.
ProvusApiController
.
invoke
(

,
arguments
)
;
Java
Copy
If you use an unsupported API name, you will receive an error indicating that
[apiName]
is not a supported API.
API Arguments (Key/Value Pairs)
When using our APIs, you'll need to provide specific data as key/value pairs. These key/value pairs are referred to as "API Arguments," and they play a crucial role in customizing your API requests. Below, we outline the required keys and their corresponding values for each API. Please ensure that you structure your requests in this format for the API to function correctly.

Platform Users
Provus is an application on the Salesforce platform that requires its own license. To use Provus, users must also have a Salesforce platform license.
If you are using a CRM other than Salesforce such as NetSuite or want to use limited Salesforce capabilities, you must have a Salesforce platform license in addition to the Provus license. This is necessary to access both Provus and Salesforce functionalities. A standard platform user should have a Salesforce Platform User License, a SalesUserPlatform permission set group, and a Standard Platform User profile.
For more information on profiles and permission sets, refer to -

You can now create a new multi-services quote(s) from opportunity using the quote wizard.
This section explains how to create an estimate based quote from the Opportunities page using the quote wizard.
To create a quote using the quote wizard:
Navigate to the
Opportunities
tab. You will see a list of opportunities created.
On the Opportunities tab, click the
Opportunity Name
hyperlink.
The selected
Opportunity
page opens.
On the Opportunity page, click
Create Services Quote
. The
Create new quote
page opens.
On the Create new quote page, select the
Project Based Services Quote
option and click
Next
.  A new page opens, where you can enter the quote parameters.
On the Create new quote page, enter details in the required fields and click
Next
.
Description
: Description of the quote.
Account
: The customer account name. The Account has a default value and becomes read-only.
Opportunity
: You will see the opportunity name linked to the quote. The Opportunity field becomes a read-only field as you are creating the quote from an opportunity.
Labor Units
: Labor units refer to the measurement of work or services in terms of headcounts (number of people) or hours (amount of time).
Time Periods
: Time periods are used to specify the duration over which a service or activity will occur. This can be measured in months, days, weeks, or quarters.
Time Periods Group Method
: This term indicates the method or frequency at which time periods are grouped or organized. Common methods include year, quarter, month, or week.
Time Periods Alignment
: Time Periods Alignment refers to how time periods are synchronized with a specific calendar. This can be user-defined or based on a weekday calendar, depending on your needs.
Rate Card
: You can select a rate card so that you can use the resource prices from the selected rate card on the quote. The Rate Card field is an editable Search box. It displays a list of active and non-expired rate cards. If an Account is specified, you will see rate cards specific to the specified account. Global rate cards (not tied to a specific account) are also available. If the Service Start Date and/or Account is changed such that the selected rate card becomes invalid.
Service Start Date
: The Service Start Date is the start date of the quote.
The
Select services to be included in the quote
page opens. You will see the list of services from the estimate templates associated with the selected rate card. Services are organized into Service Categories corresponding to the services in the estimate templates.
On the Select services to be included in the quote page, you will see two fields:
Filter Service Categories
and
Search.
The Filter service categories field allows you to filter the results based on the service category and the search field allows you to search for a specific service or a service category.
Filter service categories:
The
Filter service categories,
as a multi-select filter field, displays the text “0 selected," initially. If you click within the filter field, it displays a list of all available service categories.
Each service category is a checkbox, and you can select one or more service categories.
You can also search within the filter. The search result displays all service categories that match the entered keyword, along with checkboxes.
You can see the Clear and Apply options:
Clear will clear your selection of service categories and display "0 selected" in the filter.
Apply will apply the selected filter of service categories, but it will only be enabled when you have selected at least one service category.
After you have selected your desired service category values and applied the filter, you can see the list of services that are associated with the selected service categories.
E.g., if you have selected the “Software” service category, you will see a list of services associated with the Software service category.
The
Filter service categories
field displays the updated count indicating the number of selected categories. E.g.,"1 Selected."
Note: Service category filter update does not work when Rate Card is selected on create services quote wizard step #1.
Search Functionality:
On the “Select services to be included in the quote” page, you can search for services in the search field. This search field facilitates multi-word searches, filtering rows that match the search terms in both the
Service Category
and
Service
fields.
Note:
If you search using the keyword 'Other', search results will only be displayed if the 'Other' keyword is found either in the 'Service' name or the 'Service Category' name. Each word must be of a minimum of 2 characters for the search to work. If you are searching for multiple words, ensure that the words are from different fields.
On the Select services to be included in the quote page, select the services, and click
Next
. If you select a service that uses a different estimate template than the previously selected services, a notification appears, indicating that this action will create <count> quotes, where <count> represents the number of unique estimate templates.
For example, if you select 2 services with different estimate templates, you will see a notification, “This will create 2 quotes”.
After you click
Next,
the
Confirm service selection
page opens.
On the Confirm service selection page, click
Create Quote(s)
.
If there are services from different estimate templates, then the quotes are created for each template.
Note: For every quote created using the quote wizard, the system automatically generates corresponding estimates internally.
After successfully creating the quote(s), a success message will appear, indicating, "Quotes created successfully.” In case of an error during the quote creation process, an error message will be displayed, stating, "Error occurred during quote creation."
In the event of an error, the system will automatically roll back any created estimates and quotes to their previous state.
If only one quote is created, you will be navigated to the Quote landing page for further actions.
You can view the quotes created in the Quotes section on the Opportunities page.

Provus is natively built on Salesforce CRM and leverages Salesforce objects to create service quotes. However, some customers may choose to use custom objects for generating quotes. For example, customers might want to create services quotes from custom objects like SOW, and Project.
Provus offers the flexibility to create service quotes from custom Salesforce objects.
IMP Note: Configuring the Create Services Quote button on a custom object follows the same process as configuring it on a standard object. For more information on configuration, refer to -
Configure Create Services Quote on Custom Salesforce Object
.
You can pass the Salesforce opportunity Id and account Id during the creation of a service quote using the wizard via URL. This allows you to capture essential information when generating a quote from a Salesforce custom object. This feature is controlled by the beta flag: - "
Manage Opportunity and Account via Custom Metadata
."
This section explains how to create a quote from a custom Salesforce object.
To create a quote from a custom object:
On the custom object page, click the
Create Services Quote
button. This action triggers a URL hit on the Provus side, navigating the user to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Format
: https://<Org_Instance>/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
Parameters like opportunity ID, and account ID can be passed in the URL and stored in corresponding quote fields on the Provus side. This information is used to create a quote in Provus.
Use Case
Suppose you want to create a quote from the
Statement of Work
(Custom Salesforce object) page.
On the
Statement of Work
page, click the
Create Services Quote
button.
This action triggers a URL (with parameters) hit on the Provus side, navigating to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Example
:
{!URLFOR('/lightning/n/' & IF(CONTAINS(LOWER($Action.PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__CreateServicesQuote) ,'psq__'), 'psq__', '') & 'CreateServicesQuote' & '?c__accountId=' &  Account.Id )}
The
Account Id
parameter is passed from the Statement of Work object in the above URL.
The Create Services Quote wizard is triggered and the
Create new quote
page opens.
On the Create new quote page, select the
Quote Type
and click
Next
. The wizard displays the Account Id passed from the custom object.
On the Create new quote page, enter details in the required fields and click
Next
.
Description
: Description of the quote.
Opportunity
: You will see the opportunity name linked to the quote. The opportunity list is dependent on the Account selected.
Labor Units
: Labor units refer to the measurement of work or services in terms of headcounts (number of people) or hours (amount of time).
Time Periods
: Time periods are used to specify the duration over which a service or activity will occur. This can be measured in months, days, weeks, or quarters.
Time Periods Group Method
: This term indicates the method or frequency at which time periods are grouped or organized. Common methods include year, quarter, month, or week.
Time Periods Alignment
: Time Periods Alignment refers to how time periods are synchronized with a specific calendar. This can be user-defined or based on a weekday calendar, depending on your needs.
Rate Card
: You can select a rate card so that you can use the resource prices from the selected rate card on the quote. The Rate Card field is an editable Search box. It displays
a list of active and non-expired rate cards. If an Account is specified, you will see rate cards specific to the specified account. Global rate cards (not tied to a specific account) are also available. If the Service Start Date and/or Account is changed the selected rate card becomes invalid.
Service Start Date
: The Service Start Date is the start date of the quote.
The
Select services to be included in the quote
page opens.
You will see the list of services from the estimate templates associated with the selected rate card. Services are organized into Service Categories corresponding to the services in the estimate templates.
On the Select services to be included in the quote page, select the required services and click
Next
.
The
Confirm service selection
page opens.
On the Confirm service selection page, check and confirm the selected services and click
Create Quote(s)
.
A new services quote is created from the wizard. The parameter values passed in the URL are stored on the quote fields based on the mapping in settings.
In this use case, the Account Id parameter value is stored in the
Account
field on the quote.

As a Sales user, you can select a rate card in the
Create Quote
Wizard
so that you can use the resource prices from the selected rate card on the quote. This functionality is behind the beta feature flag - “
Allow Rate Card selection on Create Quote
.” This feature enables support for selecting a rate card during the creation of an estimate-based quote.
Note: Past dated quotes are not supported.
To select a rate card:
On the
Create Services Quote Wizard: Step 2 (Create new quote)
, you will see an optional, editable Search combo box for the Rate Card field.
The field is blank by default.
The
Search
combo box displays a list of active and non-expired rate cards. You can search and select a value from this list.
Select the Rate Card from the dropdown and click
Next
.
If an
Account
is specified:
You will see rate cards specific to the specified account.
Global rate cards
(not tied to a specific account) are also available.
If the
Service Start Date
and/or
Account
is changed such that the selected rate card becomes invalid:
The
Rate Card field
will be
cleared
.
A disappearing message appears for 3 seconds: "
Rate Card is cleared since it is not valid according to the selected Service Start Date and/or Account
."
If the selected rate card does not have an active estimate template linked:
An
inline error message
appears when you try to proceed to the next step: "
Rate Card selected does not have an active Estimate Template linked. Select another Rate Card.
"
The Provus admin
can also show/hide, set a default, or make the
Rate Card field
read-only based on custom metadata settings.
For more information on configuration, refer to:
https://docs.provusinc.com/docs/configure-create-new-quote-page-1#
On the
Create Services Quote Wizard: Step 3 (Select Services to be included in the quote)
, you will see the list of services from the estimate templates associated with the selected rate card.
Services are organized into
Service Categories
corresponding to the services in the estimate templates.

This section explains how to create a direct quote.
To create a direct quote:
On the Quotes page, click
New
.
The
New Quote
page opens.
On the New Quote page, enter the required field details and enter an
Opportunity
name.
Description
: Description of the quote.
Account
: The customer account name.
Quote Date
: The date when the quote was created.
Opportunity
: You will see the opportunity name linked to the quote if the quote is created from an opportunity. You can also link an opportunity to the quote by searching and selecting from the field.
Service
: The service name linked to the quote. You can search and select the service.
Practice
: Practice refers to a specific area or domain of expertise. For example, AWS (Amazon Web Services) can be considered a practice in the context of cloud computing services.
Group
: Group is a specialization within a practice. For instance, within the practice of AWS, "Cloud" could be a group that focuses on cloud-related services.
Labor Units
: Labor units refer to the measurement of work or services in terms of headcounts (number of people) or hours (amount of time).
Time Periods
: Time periods are used to specify the duration over which a service or activity will occur. This can be measured in months, days, weeks, or quarters.
Time Periods Group Method
: This term indicates the method or frequency at which time periods are grouped or organized. Common methods include year, quarter, month, or week.
Time Periods Alignment
: Time Periods Alignment refers to how time periods are synchronized with a specific calendar. This can be user-defined or based on a weekday calendar, depending on your needs.
Weekday Calendar
: Consider the service starts on December 5th, 2023, and the total effort is 11 days. The system aligns with the Gregorian calendar, counting only weekdays (Monday to Friday). This excludes Saturdays and Sundays. So, the end date will be December 19th, 2023, in the case of the weekday calendar.
User-Defined Calenda
r: Consider the service starts on December 5th, 2023, and the total effort is 11 days. The system initiates counting from December 5th as day 1 and progresses continuously through each consecutive day, including both Saturdays and Sundays. So, the end date will be December 15th, 2023, in case of user defined calendar. The project reaches completion earlier than the end date indicated by the weekday calendar.
For more information on user defined and weekday calendar refer to -
User Defined and Weekday Calendar (provusinc.com)
Service Start Date
: The Service Start Date is the date when a particular service or activity is scheduled to begin.
Service End Date
: The Service End Date is the date when a particular service or activity is expected to be completed.
Section Hierarchy
: Section hierarchy is a way to categorize and organize quote items based on the services being offered. In quotes without services, it categorizes quote items into sections based on activity groups. This hierarchy helps in structuring and managing quotes more efficiently.
Rate Card
: Rate Cards include the unit price of the resources for customers, the unit internal cost of the resource, and include different attributes that contribute to the pricing such as location, skill, partner resource, and so on.
Click
Save
. The A
dd Resources
page opens.
On the Add Resources page, select the resources you want to add to the quote and click
Add
. The Add resources confirmation message opens.
Click
Confirm
. A new quote is created.

tab. You will see a list of quotes created.
On the quote list page, click
Create Services Quote
. The
Create new quote
page opens.

Staffing Services Quote
option and click
Next
. The

Approving Quotes
Provus utilizes standard Salesforce approvals for quote approvals. You can configure the approval process on the Quote object. Based on the approval process, a quote can have one of three statuses: Approved, Rejected, or Pending Approval.
Locking Quotes
During the approval process, you can lock a quote. When locked, the quote becomes read-only, which is standard Salesforce behavior, preventing any modifications. Users will also see a message indicating that the quote is locked. However, the quote doesn’t automatically become read-only outside the approval process; it simply displays the message.
You can also set quotes in certain statuses as read-only for quotes without estimate temple.
A full Provus license is not required for approvals. If a user is only an approver and not a full user, then
the "ReadOnlyUser"
permission set group must be assigned to the user.

Overview
The purpose of the admin guide is to
explain all the steps required to configure the price book.
Price books track the prices of products and services that your company offers to customers.
The standard price book is the master list of all your products and their default standard prices. Salesforce creates the standard price book when you start creating product records. It includes all your products and their standard prices, regardless of any custom price books that include those products.
When a product and service is created, it must be added to the standard price book in Salesforce. You can then create an account/customer specific custom price book and add products and services.
Note:
The price book setup is required for Opportunity sync and must be configured if:
A Quote will be generated from a Salesforce Opportunity.
Sync to Opportunity is enabled.

Overview
The estimate template is designed to help Provus users generate estimates for specific scopes of work. It serves as the foundation for creating estimates and quotes for projects or services and can be used to define the effort, resources, and pricing for proposed customer engagements.
The data used to create the estimate template can also be used as input parameters for calculating task durations that will be included in an estimate or quote. The template follows a traditional project work breakdown structure (WBS) and is organized in a tree format with Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks arranged in a hierarchical manner.

An Estimate Template provides a structured framework for defining the inputs, variables, operators, and parameters that are required to estimate the effort needed to provide customers with an estimate or quote. These input variables are used to determine the pricing for the estimate and are included in the estimate to quote conversion process.
In addition, an Estimate Template allows users to customize and define the hierarchical structure of Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks that are aligned with each work stream in the estimation and quoting process. The Structure can be defined for each service.
Note: Only users with admin access can create/edit estimate templates.
The section explains how to create an estimate template.

: A service refers to a type of work or task that you offer to your customers. Services may include Professional services, Asset-based services, and Consulting services, depending on the industry and the nature of the business.
A service must be assigned on the Estimate Template dialog prior to creating a new template. The service can be set up under a product either on the screen to create the Estimate Template or under the Products tab on the Salesforce menu.
In the Service search field of the new Estimate Template dialog, you can search for an existing service by name. If you do not find the service you are looking for, you can create a new service by selecting
New Product
from the dropdown list.
When you add a service as a new product, select the
Service
option next to
Select a record type
and mark it as active so you will be able to use it in your estimate template.
To create a new Product or Service, click the
New Product
option from the dropdown list in the respective fields.
Select the
Active
box and click
Save

Overview
Provus provides two comprehensive standard dashboards as part of its out-of-the-box functionality:
Sales
and
Operations
. These dashboards deliver key insights into sales performance and operational efficiency, helping users make informed decisions.
All reports can be added to a dashboard, allowing the sales team to view relevant data in one centralized location.

Provus Integration with External CRM

Introduction
Provus is natively built on the Salesforce CRM and utilizes the Salesforce opportunity feature to create services quotes. However, customers might sometimes rely on alternative CRMs, such as NetSuite. Despite not using Salesforce, these customers still need Provus’s functionality for generating services quotes. This necessitates finding an equivalent entity to Salesforce's Opportunity within the customer's CRM, such as NetSuite's Opportunity.
Provus provides a functionality to create services quotes using NetSuite’s opportunity. Provus integration with NetSuite CRM involves both incoming and outgoing data flows between Provus and NetSuite CRM.
Note: To understand the Meta Data configuration settings for URL parameters from the external CRM, refer to
Create Quote Actions from External CRM
.
Netsuite
Integration Diagram
Authentication
Provus follows Salesforce's standard user authentication and authorization security model. Therefore, access to Provus Services quoting is granted through explicit user credentials, such as a User ID and Password, or a Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication mechanism.
In the trigger-based option, which involves invoking Provus from a button in NetSuite, clicking the "Create Quote" button within a NetSuite Opportunity will open a new browser window.
If the user is already authenticated via SSO or other means, no additional login is required. However, if the user has not been previously authenticated, they will be prompted to enter their Provus User ID and Password on the login screen.
Incoming Data Flow
This section explains the incoming data flows between Provus and NetSuite CRM.
Configure the Create Services Quote button on the NetSuite Project page
Before creating a quote, you need to configure the
Create Services Quote
button on the NetSuite Project page. This section explains how to configure the Create Services Quote button. To configure the Create Services Quote button:
On the NetSuite CRM home page, navigate to
Customization
→
Scripting
→
Scripts
→
New
to write a new JavaScript code or navigate to
Customization
→
Scripting
→
Scripts
to view existing scripts.
The
Scripts
page opens. The Scripts page displays a list of existing scripts.
To create a new script, click the
New Script
button or to view an existing script, click the script hyperlink, e.g.,
ProvusQuote.js
If you click the ProvusQuote.js hyperlink, the file details page opens where you can see the links to
download
or
Edit
JavaScript.
If you click Edit, the file editor opens where you can see the script or write a new script as required.
In the file editor, enter the JavaScript and click
Save
. The
Create Services Quote
button is now configured on the NetSuite CRM Project page.
Create a Quote
On the NetSuite Project page, click the
Create Services Quote
button. This action triggers a URL hit on the Provus side, navigating the user to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Format
: https://<Org_Instance>/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
Parameters like opportunity ID, account ID, and Service Start Date are passed in the URL and stored in corresponding quote fields on the Provus side. This information is used to create a quote in Provus.
Use Case
Suppose you want to generate a quote using the Opportunity  Id from external CRM like NetSuite.
On the NetSuite Opportunity/Project page, click the
Create Services Quote
button.
This action triggers a URL (with parameters) hit on the Provus side, navigating to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Example
:
https://provus-qa-next.lightning.force.com/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?c__serviceStartDate=2024-03-01&c__Extoppid=MD44
The
Service Start Date
and
External Opportunity Id
parameters and their values are passed from the external CRM in the above URL.
The Create Services Quote wizard is triggered and the
Create new quote
page opens.
On the Create new quote page, select the
Quote Type
and click
Next
. The wizard displays the service start date passed from the external CRM. Enter the required details and click
Next
.
The
Select services to be included in the quote
page opens.
On the Select services to be included in the quote page, select the required services and click
Next
.
The
Confirm service selection
page opens.
On the Confirm service selection page, check and confirm the selected services and click
Create Quote(s)
.
A new services quote is created from the wizard. The parameter values passed in the URL are stored on the quote fields based on the mapping in settings.
In this use case, the external opportunity id parameter is stored in the text field
External Opportunity Id
on the quote.
Note: For each parameter sent from the external CRM, you can create a custom field on the Provus quote with only the following data types:
Text
Date (Format: YYYY:MM:DD)
Picklist
If a parameter value is modified on the UI during the quote field update, the modified value is stored on the quote field.
A parameter is not stored if it is not present in the setting.
The quote field values are retained when a copy of the quote is created in the following scenarios:
Clone
Make Primary
Scenario
Create a Template and Quote from the template
If multiple quotes are created, the same parameter values are stored on all quotes.
If quote creation fails and an error is presented on the final screen of the create services quote wizard, the parameters remain available for the next attempt to create a quote, without the need for initiation from an external CRM.
An error is generated if a field is not found.
An error is generated if a parameter is not found.
Passing Data from External CRM to Provus
The following recipe in Workato brings data from Netsuite to Provus as soon as the quote is created in Provus.

As a Provus admin user, you can show or hide fields on the quote grid based on the visibility expression. This ensures that sales users do not see unnecessary fields.
You can configure fields shown on the quote grid (via Provus Component Configurations: QuoteAncillaries, QuoteConfigurator, QuoteConfiguratorCard, ResourceAllocationCard) with the following capabilities:
Ability to show or hide fields based on the visibility expression, with the following features:
Support for logical conditions on Quote fields using API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__EstimateId__c, BillingType__c). Example expression: “PSQ__QuoteType__c.PSQ__TimePeriod__c == Quarters”.
Ability to use Product fields, Standard fields, or Custom fields in the visibility expression.
If the condition evaluates to true, the field is displayed; otherwise, it is hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error is displayed when the quote is opened.
This configuration applies to both non-estimate and estimate-based quotes. It does not apply to the Resource Role and Rate Card attribute group columns.
Suppose you want to show the Base Price column on the quote grid only when the Quote period is set as “Quarters”.
To configure the field:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Quote Configurator
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, change the Base Price column visibility setting to:
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"grids"
:
{
"quoteGrid"
:
{
"columns"
:
{
"basePrice"
:
{
"visible"
:
{
"expression"
:
"PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__TimePeriod__c == Quarters"
}
,
"readonly"
:
false
}
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
Click
Save
.
The
Base Price
column is visible on the quote grid if the Quote Period is equal to “Quarters” and hidden if the Quote Period is not equal to “Quarters”.
Quote Period is Quarters: The
Base Price
column is visible.
Quote Period is Months: The
Base Price
column is hidden.

Manage Quotes Configuration
Configure Field Visibility Based on Filter Expressions

Overview
The purpose of this admin guide is to provide Provus administrators with a comprehensive understanding of how to configure and manage the field visibility controls based on quote type.
This feature introduces the ability to configure and control the visibility of fields across various sections of a quote—
Quote Item Fields on the Quote Grid
,
Quote Summary
Components
, and
Quote Header Fields
—based on the type of quote being created. It ensures that only relevant fields are displayed for each quote type.
Currently, the visibility of columns in the quote configurator is controlled through metadata configuration, which applies universally across all quotes within an organization. This means you can enable or disable specific columns, such as "Person Month" or "Period Groups," but the settings are global and cannot be customized for different types of quotes.
With this enhancement, you can define visibility filter expressions to display or hide specific fields based on the type of quote being created.
Use Cases
Managed Services Quotes: Hide columns that are not relevant to managed services, such as specific financial metrics.
Time and Material (T&M) Projects: Display "Time Tracking" or "Resource Allocation" columns only for T&M projects.
Fixed Bid Projects: Exclude "Effort Estimation" columns for fixed bid projects while keeping them visible for other types.

As a Provus admin, you can to show or hide the markup/discount options based on the visibility expression. This ensures that the sales user does not see unnecessary information.
As a Provus admin, you are able to configure COLA, Contingency, Volume Discounts, Location Discounts, and Tiered Discounts displayed on Adjust Pricing with the following capabilities:
Ability to show or hide options based on a visibility expression.
Support for logical conditions on Quote fields using API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__estimateId__c, BillingType__c).
Example: PSQ__QuoteType__c == "True"
If the condition is true, the option is displayed; otherwise, it is hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error is thrown when opening a quote.
This configuration applies to both direct quotes and estimate-based quotes.
Suppose you want to show the Discounts tab in Adjust Pricing dialog only when the Time Periods Group is “Year”.
To configure the field:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Adjust Quote Pricing
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, change the
Discounts
tab visibility setting to:
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"tabs"
:
{
"discounts"
:
{
"visible"
:
{
"expression"
:
"PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__TimePeriodsGroupMethod__c == Year"
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
Click
Save
.
The
Discounts tab
is visible only when the Time Periods Group is equal to “Year”.
Time Periods Group:
Year
Discount
tab is visible.
Time Periods Group:
Quarters
Disounts
tab is hidden.

This section explains how to configure the sequence of fields on the quote grid.
To configure the sequence:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Quote Configurator
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field,  set the sequence value for a field, then click
Save
. For example, set the sequence for the field Rate Card Cost as 2.
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"grids"
:
{
"quoteGrid"
:
{
"rows"
:
{
"totalPersonUnits"
:
{
"visible"
:
true
}
,
"totalAmount"
:
{
"visible"
:

}
}
,
"columnGroups"
:
{
"periods"
:
{
"visible"

,
"readonly"
:
false
}
,
"periodGroupTotals"
:
{
"visible"
:
true
}
}
,
"columns"
:
{
"rateCardCost"
:
{
"visible"
:

,
"sequence"

}
,
"basePrice"
:
{
"visible"

,
"readonly"
:
false
,
"sequence"
:

}
,
"discountPercent"
:
{
"visible"
:
true
,
"readonly"
:
false
,
"sequence"
:
3
}
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
The
Rate Card Cost
field will now appear as the second column in the quote grid.
Note:
Ensure that the sequence value is also set for both
QuoteConfiguratorCard
and
ResourceAllocationCard
in the Provus Component Configuration.
If the sequence is not set for QuoteConfiguratorCard, the specified field order will not be reflected on the
Price Grid
in the Quote Summary.
If the sequence is not set for ResourceAllocationCard, the field order will not appear on the
Resource Grid
in the Quote Summary.

To define a formula for a quote grid field:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to
Setup
.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The

is the Hashtag name of Parameter 1 as defined in the estimate template.

As a Provus user, you can now define a formula for calculating values using custom fields in the quote. This allows you to establish a formula based on the fields in the quote.
This feature is behind the feature flag: “
Enable HyperFormula for fields on quote
.”
As a Provus admin, you can set values for fields in the quote grid using HyperFormula with the following capabilities:
Define HyperFormula in the custom metadata settings.
Support for all mathematical operators and functions is available in HyperFormula.
Use fields from the Quote Item, Quote, Estimation Input Parameter (using hashtags), and Rate Card Item (linked to Quote Item) with API names.
Example: PSQ__TotalPersonUnit__c + PSQ__TotalAdjustments__c, Count__c * PSQ__TotalPersonUnit__c.
If the formula evaluation is successful, the evaluated values are displayed in the quote grid based on the formula defined in the custom metadata settings.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error message will be displayed when opening the quote.
This configuration applies to both direct quotes and estimate-based quotes.
If a default value property and a formula are both set for a custom field, the formula takes precedence.
To create a custom field and configure its visibility, refer to:
Configure Custom Fields
To define a formula for custom field:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to
Setup
.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Field Configuration
label. The
Field Configurations
page opens.
On the Field Configurations page, click
New
. The
Field Configuration Edit
page opens.
On the Field Configuration Edit page, enter the details (You will find the field details in the Object Manager.) of the custom field and enter a formula in the
Value Source
field and then click
Save
.
You will see the custom field on the quote grid is populated with values based on the defined formula.

Change the Sequence of Header Fields
Note:
Before you change the sequence of the header fields, add the Sequence field in the layout of the custom metadata.
To change the sequence of the quote header fields:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
. The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to
Datatable Column Config
label. The
Datatable Column Config
page opens.
On the Datatable Column Config page, click
Edit
next to the field for which you want to change the sequence.
For Example, click
Edit
next to the
Discount Amount
label
.
The
Datatable Column Config
(Managed)
page opens.
On the Datatable Column Config (Managed) page, enter a new number in the
Sequence
field for Discount Amount and click
Save
.
Discount Amount field with sequence number 1:
Discount Amount field with sequence number 3:
Note:
If two fields in the quote header are assigned the same sequence number, they will be displayed in alphabetical order.
For example, if the fields are initially given the sequences 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14, and then a new field is assigned sequence 6 and marked as Active, the fields will be displayed as 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14. However, if the field with sequence 6 is marked as inactive, the fields will be shown as 5, 7, 9, 12, 14.  The first six active fields will be displayed regardless of their sequence numbers, even if the sequence number exceeds 10.

The Quote Header Fields section displays ten fields by default for all types of quotes. In some cases, you may want to display a different set of fields on the quote header based on the type of quote.
For example, if you are working with a Managed Services Quote, you might need to show specific fields that differ from those in a Professional Services Quote. By configuring the quote header fields accordingly, you can ensure that users see only the most relevant information for each quote type.
This section explains how to configure different sets  of the quote header fields.
To configure the quote header fields, follow these three steps:

To create a new datatable column config:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the

label. The

To improve quote accuracy, Provus admin can now view and modify country-specific labor working hours. This enhancement ensures that calculated hours on quotes reflect accurate regional labor standards.
This feature is controlled by the beta feature flag - “
Enable Working Hours by Country
”, which is disabled by default.
To set up working hours by country:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to
Setup
.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the Manage Records hyperlink next to
Schedule Setting
label. The
Schedule Settings
page opens.
On the Schedule Settings page, click the
Standard Schedule
label hyperlink with
PSQ Namespace Prefix.
The
Schedule Setting
(Managed)
page opens.
On the Schedule Setting (Managed) page, click
Clone
.
A clone of the Schedule Setting is created.
Set the following field values for a specific country (For example, India), enter a new
Label
and click
Save
.
Field Details
:
Country
: Editable picklist field populated with country values (using the global picklist).
Hours in a Standard Day
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a Standard Week
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a Standard Month
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a Standard Year
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
The new Schedule Setting is created for that specific country.
You can view the new schedule setting on the Schedule Settings list page.

As a Provus admin user, you can show/hide the components on the quote summary tab based on the visibility expression so that the sales user does not see unnecessary information.
You can show/hide based on the visibility expression with the following features:
Support logical conditions on the Quote fields using their API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__esitmateId__c, BillingType__c)
If the condition is evaluated as true, the component is displayed on the quote; otherwise, it is hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error is displayed when opening a quote.
This configuration applies to both non-estimate and estimate-based quotes.
Suppose you want to show the
Resource Allocation
card on the quote summary only when the Quote status is “Draft”.
To configure the card:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Quote Summary Tab
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, change the Resource Allocation visibility setting to:
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"panels"
:
{
"resourceAllocation"
:
{
"visible"
:
{
"expression"
:
"PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__Status__c == Draft"
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
Click
Save
.
The
Resource Allocation
card is only visible on the quote summary when the quote status is “Draft”.
Quote Status is
Draft
: The
Resource Allocation
card is visible on the quote summary.
Quote Status is
Approved
: The
Resource Allocation
card is hidden on the quote summary.

As a Provus admin, you now can configure the visibility of summary tables on the
Summary
tab. This customization ensures that users only see the tables set as visible based on your preferences and business requirements.
This feature applies to both Direct and Estimate-based quotes.
You can define the visibility filters using expressions to control which tables are shown through component settings. When users access the Summary tab of a quote, they will see the summary tables based on the configured settings.
You can configure the following tables:
Quote Totals
Resource Role Summary
Resource Role (Displayed) Summary
Period Group Summary
Location Summary
Section Summary
Managed Services Summary
Suppose you want to show the
Quote Totals
table on the summary tab only when the Time Period  is set as “Months”.
To configure the table:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Summary Tab
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, change the Quote Totals visibility setting to:
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"panels"
:
{
"quoteTotals"
:
{
"visible"
:
{
"expression"
:
"PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__TimePeriod__c==Months"
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
Click
Save
.
The
Quote Totals
table is only visible on the summary when the Time Period is “Months”.
Time Period is
Months
:
Quote Totals
table is visible on the Summary tab:
Time Period is
Weeks
:

As a Provus admin user, you can now show or hide tabs on quotes/estimates to ensure that sales users only see relevant tabs.
You can show or hide tabs based on a visibility expression with the following features:
Support for logical conditions using Quote fields with API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__estimateId__c, BillingType__c). Example: PSQ__QuoteType__c == "True"
Use of Product, Standard, or Custom fields in the expression.
If the condition evaluates to true, the tab is displayed; otherwise, it remains hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error message will be displayed when opening the quote.
This configuration applies to both direct non-estimate and estimate-based quotes.
Suppose you want to show the
Scope
tab only when the quote status is  “Draft” and hide for any other quote status.
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Quote Page Container
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, change the Resource Allocation visibility setting to:
{
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"tabs"
:
{
"scope"
:
{
"visible"
:
{
"expression"
:
"PSQ__Quote__c.PSQ__Status__c == Draft"
}
}
}
}
JSON
Copy
Click
Save
.
The Scope tab is visible if the quote status is “Draft” and hidden for any other quote status.
Quote status is
Draft
:  The
Scope
tab is visible:

Each quote can be categorized under different statuses such as
Draft
,
Pending Approval
,
Approved
,
Active
,
Rejected
, or
Inactive
. Depending on the specific status of a quote, you can display or hide the corresponding action buttons.
This section explains how to hide the Provus action buttons based on the quote status.
The following quote shows the
Adjust Pricing
action button on the primary quote in
Draft
status.
Suppose you want to hide the
Adjust Pricing
button on a primary quote if the quote status is
Pending Approval, Approved, or Rejected
.
To hide the action button:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
.  The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click
the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the Page Action label. The
Page Actions
page opens.
On the Page Actions page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the action button label you want to modify.
The
Page Action (Managed)
page opens.
On the Page Action (Managed) page, enter a condition with the correct syntax in the
Visibility Filter
field and click
Save
.
E.g., if the quote status is
not equal to Pending Approval, Approved
, or
Rejected
then only show the
Adjust Pricing
button or else hide it. The
Adjust Pricing
action button is now hidden on all quotes with
Pending Approval
,
Approved,
and
Rejected
status.
Note:
If you use a Provus field in the visibility filter, the field must include the namespace prefix PSQ__.
For example, PSQ__Status__c.

The quote header fields section displays ten fields by default.
The following four fields are fixed fields and are visible for all quotes and scenarios:
Quote Name
Description
Total Amount
Margin % - Visible as per the permission set - For more information on permission sets, refer to the
User Permissions and Access Control Admin Guide
.
The following six fields are displayed from the custom metadata type
Datatable Column Config
in the following defined sequence:
Discount Amount
Total Amount (Hyperlink)
Total Adjustments
Total Add-ons Amount
Service Start Date
Opportunity
Total Cost - Visible as per the permission set.
For more information on permission sets, refer to the
User Permissions Access Control Admin Guide
.
These fields are read-only and are included within the Provus pre-installed package. You cannot delete these six fields. However, you can create a new field and change the sequence of the fields through the custom metadata type
Datatable Column Config
as needed. You can only delete the field that you have created.
For more information on how to add Provus components to customized quotes, refer to
Provus Components Integration into Custom Quote Record Page
Admin Guide.
Create a New Quote Header Field
To create a new quote header field:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
. The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the Manage Records hyperlink next to the
Datatable Column Config
label. The
Datatable Column Config
page opens.
On the Datatable Column Config page, click
New
. The
Datatable Column Config Edit
page opens.
On the Datatable Column Config Edit page, enter the information in the following mandatory fields:
Label
,
Datatable Config
,
Column Field Name
, and
Datatable Column Config Name
. Additionally, you can change the sequence of the fields through the
Sequence
field, and you can manage the width of each custom field on the header through
Column Properties JSON
.
Note:
The
Column Field Name
is the API name of the field. You can retrieve the API name by accessing the Object Manager. For instance, if you require the API name for the "Account Id" field within the context of a quote, navigate to
Object Manager > Quote > Fields & Relationships > Account
.
Datatable Column Config Name should be QuoteHeader_<label without space and underscore>. E.g., QuoteHeader_Account
You can view the custom field only if you have field-level access.
Click
Save

This section explains how to initiate the Create Services Quote wizard from external CRM.
To
initiate the Create Services Quote wizard from external CRM
:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
. The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Create Service Quote Detail
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, configure the expression for the parameter that will pass from external CRM to Provus and click
Save
. For example, the value for the parameter External Opportunity Id will be accepted at run time.
Note:
Specify the date in YYYY-MM-DD (2023-11-09) format only in the Json.
The parameter values passed in the URL are stored on the quote fields. In this use case, the external opportunity id parameter is stored in the text field
External Opportunity Id
on the quote.
To create a new field on the quote, refer to -
Create New Field on the Quote
Note:
For each parameter sent from the external CRM, you can create a custom field on the Provus quote with only the following data types:
Text
Date (Format: YYYY:MM:DD)
Picklist
If the field configured in meta data is not present on object, you will see an error message and a Quote will still be created.
If the external CRM sends a parameter that is not present in meta data, the system ignores the parameter and creates a Quote.

The quote type selection feature is now generally available to all users, as the “
New Create Services Quote Wizard
” beta feature flag is being removed. When you click the Create Services Quote button, you will now see Step 1 of the wizard: Select the Quote Type.
However, depending on the type of quote, you may not need a quote selection page. If that’s the case, you can configure the custom metadata to hide the Select Quote Type page as desired.
This section explains how to hide the Select Quote Type (Step 1) of the Create Services Quote

On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types

Overview
To determine the project's schedule, Provus Services Quoting uses two types of calendar definitions based on the Quote header attribute named "Time Period Alignment":
Weekday Calendar:
This follows the standard calendar definitions of weeks, months, quarters, and years.
User-Defined Calendar:
This allows a company to create its own definitions for weeks, months, quarters, and years.
While creating a quote, you can select the required option from the Time Periods Alignment dropdown.
The definition also uses one or more schedule settings (admin settings) at the org level.
Weekday Calendar
This option uses the actual dates for a given year, quarter, and month. When this option is used, the following definitions apply:
Day:
Allocated hours:
The default is 40 hours, but this can be adjusted to more or less than 40 in the schedule settings at the org level.
Week:
Definition:
A calendar week is defined from Sunday to Saturday (7 days) with actual working days from Monday through Friday (5 days). If a service start date falls on any day from Tuesday through Friday, the first week will be considered a partial week for effort allocation.
Allocated hours:
Number of working days in a week * hours per day.
Month:
Definition:
Starts from the 1st day of the month and continues until the actual end date of the month.
Allocated hours:
Number of working days in a month * hours per day.
Quarter:
Definition:
Starts from the 1st day of the quarter and continues until the actual end date of the quarter (i.e., Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct-Dec).
Allocated hours:
Number of working days in a quarter * hours per day.
Year:
Definition:
Starts from the 1st day of the calendar year and continues until the actual end date of the year (i.e., January 1st to December 31st).
Allocated hours:
Number of working days in a year * hours per day.
Accordingly, the project schedule will reflect resource and effort allocation for the time periods and time period groups on the quote.
User Defined Calendar
This option is controlled by the schedule settings (admin settings) and the related definitions of standard hours in a day, week, month, and year. Accordingly, the user-defined calendar provides more flexibility for quoting with a standard definition of hours per time period and time period group.
Hours in a standard day:
The default value is 8, which can be set to more or fewer hours.
Hours in a standard week:
The default value is 40, which can be set to more or fewer hours.
Hours in a standard month:
The default value is 160, which can be set to more or fewer hours.
Hours in a standard year:
The default value is 1920, which can be set to more or fewer hours
.
Based on the above settings, the number of days, weeks, and months are calculated as follows:
Days in a Week:
Calculation:
Hours in a standard week / Hours in a standard day
Can be more or less than 5 days
Example:
40 / 8 = 5 days
Fractional days are rounded up to the next whole number.
Weeks in a Month:
Calculation:
Hours in a standard month / Hours in a standard week
Can be more or less than 4 weeks
Examples:
160 / 40 = 4 weeks or 200 / 40 = 5 weeks
Fractional weeks are rounded up to the next whole number.
Months in a Year:
Calculation:
Hours in a standard year / Hours in a standard month
Can be more or less than 12 months
Examples:
1920 / 160 = 12 months or 2040 / 170 = 12 months
Fractional months are rounded up to the next whole number.
Weekday Calendar Behavior
Direct Quotes
Number of hours calculation for each time period:
The system calculates the number of hours for each time period using only the day and week from the Schedule Setting.
Time Periods
Calculation
Example
Hours in day
Direct value from Schedule Setting. No calculation
Hours in a week
Direct value from Schedule Setting. No calculation
Hours in a month
Number of weekdays in a year * 8 / 12
Number of weekdays in a year = All weekdays in the starting calendar year based on quote service start date
Calculated at Quote level
For Example,
In 2024, the monthly hours are calculated as 262*8/12 = 174.66
In 2025, the monthly hours are 174 hours.
Hours in a quarter
Number of weekdays in a year * 8 / 12 * 3

When Calendar = User Defined Calendar, Time Periods = Weeks, Time Period Group Method = Quarters
Number of weeks per month calculation
Other Related Calculations
Quarters in a Year:
3 months per quarter.
Months in a Quarter:
Hours in a Roundup(standard Year / Hours in a standard month / 4)
Example:
1920 / 160 / 4 = 3 months
Weeks in a Quarter:
Roundup(Hours in a standard Year / Hours in a standard week / 4)
Example:
2080 / 40 / 4 = 13 weeks
Weeks in a Year:
Roundup(Hours in a standard year / Hours in a standard week)
Example:
2080 / 40 = 52 weeks
Recommended Schedule Settings
: While using the User Defined Calendar, set the hours in the Time Period and Time Period groups correctly to get the expected results.
Example:
Time Period -  Weeks and Time Period Groups - Year:
Use the below settings to get 52 weeks in a year
Hours in a standard day:
default value is 8
Hours in a standard week:
default value is 40
Hours in a standard Year:
default value is 2080

Overview
The purpose of this admin guide is to provide detailed instructions on adding a Provus component to a customized lightning record page of Quote.
When you install the Provus package, it includes pre-installed objects, each of which comes with a Lightning Record Page. A Lightning Record Page is a collection of several components displayed on a single web page.
If you decide to customize the quote page, a new version of quote lightning record page is generated. Any newly developed Provus component needs to be manually added to the customized quote page.
There are two methods to incorporate all the component into your custom quote page.
View the Lightning Record Pages
To view the Quote object lightning record pages, navigate to
Setup
>
Object Manager
>
Quote
>
Lightning Record Pages
.
The Quote label is the Provus managed record page and Quote Record Page is the customized page.
Add Components of Provus Quote Object to Custom Quote
Method 1
:
Go to
Setup
>
Object Manager
>
Quote

Quote Header Highlight Fields
and
Quote Header Nav Bar
as shown below:
To add a Provus component to the custom record page, click the component name hyperlink and drag and drop in the custom record page layout in the middle pane.
For example, to add the quote header fields, click the

Permission Set Groups
You can bundle the permission sets together based on a resource role in
Permission Set Groups
. A permission set group includes all permissions linked to a group. You can even include a permission set in more than one permission set group.
Permission set groups enable organizations to provide a consistent user experience to the user based on the group to which they are assigned.
Provus has created three core permission set groups that provide users with unique permissions based on their assigned user roles.
The following permission set groups are shipped with the Provus solution as Out of the Box (OOB) functionality.
SalesUser
SalesManager
ProvusAdmin
SalesUserPlatform
ReadOnlyUser
Provus Permission Set Groups can be used with any user profile as long as the custom object permissions for Provus objects are removed from the profile. This ensures that the permission settings defined in the Permission Set Group are effective.
If you need to provide additional permissions for Opportunity access to the Customer/Professional services users, you can create a new Permission Set or modify an existing one. You can then assign this Permission Set to the users who require extended access.
SalesUser Permission Set Group
Sales users interface with customers and are responsible for preparing quotes and negotiating deals. Sales users need to be able to price deals with access to revenue numbers, quotes, estimates, opportunities, proposals, etc. It is not necessary for sales users to see the pricing structure of deals. They do not need to see cost/margin, rate cards, or manage products.
Sales User access includes and excludes the following:
Can Access - View and Manage
Cannot View and Manage
Quotes
Cost and Margin
Estimates
Rate Cards
Estimate Templates
Product Master
Opportunity
Proposals
SalesManager Permission Set Group
Sales managers are responsible for working closely with sales representatives to approve and authorize deals to complete the sales process. Sales managers are able to access quotes, estimates, opportunities, proposals, estimate templates, and cost/margin data.
Since sales managers are responsible for managing overall profitability and closing sales deals, they are not responsible for managing things like experimental features, rate cards, or adding and maintaining master product files.
The sales manager needs to quickly and accurately make the best decision for the profitability of customer relationships to expedite the sales process, close deals, and deliver margin and revenue goals to the organization.
Sales Manager Access includes and excludes the following:
Can Access - View and Manage
Cannot View and Manage
Quotes
Experimental Features
Estimates
Rate Cards
Estimate Templates
Product Master
Opportunity
Proposals
Cost and Margin
Assets
Provus Admin Permission Set Group
The Provus administrator has elevated privileges and access to various fields and objects within the system. An admin can create, modify, and delete user accounts. They can assign roles, permissions, and access levels to individual users or groups.
Provus Administrator Access includes the following:
Can Access - View and Manage
Quotes
Estimates
Estimate Templates
Opportunity
Proposals
Cost and Margin
Rate Cards
Product Master
Experimental Features
Assets
ReadOnlyUser Permission Set Group
If you want to provide read-only access to Provus to certain users, now you can use Provus's read-only access capability. Read-only users will be able to view the quote but will not be able to edit or delete it.
This is managed through a permission set group called "ReadOnlyUser", which is part of the Provus package.
SalesUserPlatform Permission Set Group
Provus is an application on the Salesforce platform that requires its own license. To use Provus, you must also have a Salesforce platform license.
When a Provus license is provisioned to users who are already Salesforce users, they typically already possess the Salesforce platform license.
For customers using a CRM other than Salesforce, such as NetSuite, they must acquire a Salesforce platform license in addition to the Provus license. This is necessary to access both Provus and Salesforce functionalities. These users will create quotes using their external CRM and will not create quotes through Salesforce opportunities.
The following table lists the
Provus Permission Set Groups
and the
Permission Sets

Provus User Profiles
Provus has created a Standard User Profile. This profile can be assigned to a user or a role. You can grant permissions to the user profile based on the needs as defined by the organization.
In Provus, based on the settings for the
Standard User
profile, when you assign the Standard User profile to the Sales User, the Sales User typically has access to and can view and manage the following objects/fields:
Quotes
Estimates
Opportunity
Proposals
Estimate Templates
The sales user does not have access to and cannot view and manage the following objects/fields:
Cost and Margin
Rate Cards
Product Master
It is important to properly manage user access to custom fields to ensure data security and compliance with organizational policies.
Custom Object Level Permissions
Object level permissions specify the base-level access users have to create, read, edit, and delete records for each object. Provus has different object types such as Activities, Activity Group, Activity Template, Activity Group Template, Estimate Template, and so on.
When setting up a standard profile you want to assign to users, you can identify the Provus objects you want to grant or revoke access to.
To grant or revoke access to specific Provus objects for a profile:

On the Setup Home page, enter “profiles” in the Quick Find box, then select Profiles.
The
Profiles
page opens and displays a list of all the profiles.
Click
Edit
corresponding to the profile for which you want to change the access.
On the Profile Edit page, go to
Custom Object Permissions
.
Select or Deselect the
Read
,
Create
,
Edit
, or
Delete
checkboxes as per your organization’s requirement.
Click
Save
.
Custom Field Level Permissions
Field permissions specify the access level for each field in an object.
For example, if Quote is the object, the fields on the Quote can be Currency, Discount Amount, Margin %, and so on. You can specify the access at the field level on the Quote.
To grant or revoke access to specific fields of an object:
In the upper right corner of the Salesforce home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
In the left navigation pane, select
Users
>
Profiles
.
The
Profiles
page opens and displays a list of all profiles.
Select the profile for which you want to change the access to custom fields. (e.g.,
Standard User
profile)
You can see the profile details for the selected profile.
On the Profiles page, go to
Field-Level Security
>
Custom Field-Level Security
.
Click the
View
hyperlink corresponding to the setting you want to change.
For example, click the
View
hyperlink corresponding to the
Quote

Overview
Provus services quoting solution is built natively on the Salesforce platform. Giving the right access to the right users is critical to streamlining business efficiency while appropriately managing security.
Provus leverages Salesforce profiles and permission set groups to identify permissions that can be applied to specific users.
A Profile and a Permission Set Group are two different ways to manage user permissions and access control:
Profile
: A profile is a collection of settings and permissions that define what a user can do within Salesforce. It controls access to objects, fields, records, and various features and functionalities. Profiles are typically assigned to users based on their roles or job responsibilities. Each user can have only one profile.
Every Salesforce org includes predefined standard profiles that you can assign to users. Provus assigns the
Standard Platform User
profile to users.
Permission Set Group
: A Permission Set Group is a collection of permission sets that can be assigned to users or other permission set groups. It allows you to group related permission sets together for easier management. Permission sets within a group can be assigned to users in addition to their profile, providing additional permissions or access to specific features. This allows for more flexible and granular control over user permissions.
Profiles provide a baseline set of permissions for users, while permission sets and permission set groups allow for additional permissions to be assigned on top of the profile. Profiles are assigned directly to users, whereas permission sets and permission set groups can be assigned to users or other groups.

Use Cases and Formula Examples
Use Case #1 - Simple multiplication
Consider you have a customer who has identified that they will require 12 specific software modules to be built to track inventory from purchase through to production. The modules have been identified, and the requirements have been specified. The customer now comes to you for an estimate to design the modules.
In Provus, you are able to create an estimation template to define the scope of the effort using the WBS in the estimate tree.
You may choose to define an estimation parameter such as
No. of Modules
.
After defining the WBS and the estimation parameter, you are ready to enter a formula in the formula builder. The formula can be extremely simple or vary in complexity based on the calculations necessary to determine the level of effort for a task.
The examples below illustrate three different ways to create a simple multiplication formula on the formula builder.
When you know the duration of a specific task and the task is repeated multiple times, you can use a simple product function to calculate task duration.
As an example, when it takes 20 hours to design a module, you can use the following formula to calculate the total time to build a specific number of modules. The calculation will be made when a specific number of modules are defined on the estimation inputs tab of the estimate.
If you decide to keep the math extremely simple and you know that you will only need to multiply the number of modules by 20 hours, the amount of time required to design each module, you can use the operator * to create a very simple multiplication formula:
There are several ways to calculate a formula in the formula builder, including simple mathematical expressions or using common logical formulas.
If you require multiple inputs to be added together to determine the duration required to build, then you can add those input items together and multiply the sum by the total number of modules being designed.
As an example, if it takes 4 hours to review requirements, 2 hours to analyze the best platform for each module, 4 hours to research the design approach, and 12 hours to design the module, you could create the following formula in the formula builder:
Use Case #2 - Using Average as a Function
You can use the average function in the formula builder to define task duration in a number of ways, depending on the specific data you are working with. Generally, the average function will calculate the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, and you can use it to determine the average time that a task will take.
Consider an example where you create the following estimate template:
Define estimation parameters as shown below:
After defining the Estimation parameters, you are able to define a task parameter that will allow you to calculate the average of specified parameters.
Suppose you create the following formula in the formula builder using the AVERAGE function to estimate the task duration for Testing. When you expect testing to take 50% of the average time to build modules and provide audit preparation assistance, you are able to create the following formula to calculate an average duration for testing:
You can create an estimate based on the above estimate template and add effort values to the parameters as shown below:
You will see that the effort value is calculated according to the formula created in the formula builder.
Use Case #3 - Generating Level of Effort from a Picklist
Picklists are an excellent option for determining the level of effort based on repeating or defined criteria related to an engagement.
When you have an engagement that requires a specific level of expertise, a unique level of complexity, or a defined level of research, you can use picklists to define these unique characteristics and the required level of effort that may be used on the task. The use case below provides an example of how you can use a picklist to determine the level of effort.
ABC Company needs to analyze the existing and required controls for a payment solution. They can use a picklist to determine the level of effort for a control assessment. Based upon their expertise in analyzing controls for payment solutions, ABC company has created a picklist required to complete the task controls assessment.
Below is an example of Setting up picklist values as estimation parameters on the estimate template for the
User-defined parameter
Control Assessment.
After setting up the picklist estimation parameter, you will need to specify the estimation parameter is the one you want to use in the formula builder. You do this by clicking on
Add/edit task parameters.
When on Add/edit task parameters, you simply specify the parameter with the picklist for the estimation parameter you want to use.
When the estimate template is converted to an estimate, you will need to specify the estimation parameter being used to identify that a picklist value is required.
In the example below, you will be able to select the picklist option that best defines the scope of work required for the
User-defined parameter
Control Documentation.
Use Case #4 - Picklist value defines an input as part of a logical string
The preceding use case displays how a picklist can be used to determine the overall scope of a task parameter and define the value for a task.
Additionally, a picklist can be used to define another input variable included in a logical string formula. For example, you can use a picklist to define the type of system being worked on, which can be used within a string formula. The parameter will only define the system as a subcomponent included within the logical string formula.
As an example, you may want to choose the type of system being worked on as part of a task parameter. You can identify the following system types as
User-defined parameters
using the Estimation parameters button as follows:
If you have the ability to define a scope of work with multiple alternative parameters, you may use the picklist to define one set of parameters; for example, when you set up a parameter called “System” as an Estimation parameter, then you may use alternate naming conventions to identify each system:
An example of how a picklist used to identify an input parameter in a more complex logical formula is demonstrated
Use Case #7
below.
Use Case #5 - Using Tiers to Establish Level of Effort
Tiers provide a great way to provide an estimate when input values may fall within a numeric range, and a level of effort to complete the work can be determined by using the value range.
As an example, when you work on engagements that require planning and building a detailed requirements document, you can define the expected duration of building the document by assigning a level of effort for the engagement based on the number of requirements to be completed. This is done by setting up tiers for the
User-defined parameter
on the Estimation parameter dialog.
An example of using tiers to estimate the duration for creating a requirements document is shown below:
When you convert the estimate template to an estimate, and add values on the Estimation Inputs dialog, then you can input a tier value and view the level of effort as follows:
Use Case #6 - Creating a Value by Checking the Box
A checkbox can be used to define a task duration when the task may or may not be required, and duration is able to be assigned if the task is required.
As an example, if Release Notes are a required task, and the box is checked next to release notes, then you will see the assigned Estimation parameter check box value for release notes is assigned to the task.
An example of setting up the checkbox task duration is provided below:
Use Case #7 - Using a logical If Then Statement
You can use common
if-then
statements within Provus to determine the value of an estimation parameter.
Consider you have two input parameters, one input for
No. of Features
and another input for
No. of Modules
. You know testing will take 4 hours to complete for the highest unit of input for either number of modules or the number of features.
In the example below, you can create an
if-then statement
that identifies the greater number of features or modules that will be used to determine the expected testing duration.
If the number of features exceeds the number of modules, the number of features will be used to determine the duration of testing.
If the number of modules exceeds the number of features, then the number of modules will be used to determine the testing duration.
In the example below, the greater number of features or modules is multiplied by the number four to specify the number of hours required for testing.
On the Estimation inputs sub-tab of the Scope tab, you will see that the estimation input value for Features is 45, and the estimation input value for Modules is 22. Since the testing duration will be calculated based on the above if-then statement, and 45 is greater than 22, the total testing duration will be
Features (45) * 4 hours.
On the
Effort
tab, you will notice the calculation duration for all tabs is provided, including the calculation of the formula relying upon the
If-Then Statement
. The calculation of 45 * 4 = 180 which is the expected test duration based on the formula and inputs provided in the statement.
Use Case #8 - Using a logical If Then Statement with Non-numeric input values
One more complex use case for building formulas within an estimate template is leveraging the logic of an
if-then statement
to compute task durations when variables such as level of complexity, task sequencing, and resource experience are all key components in determining appropriate resource and level of effort calculations.
With a complex statement, you are able to identify an input as a non-numeric value, such as a solution or system being implemented where system A = 1 in a picklist and system B = 2, system C = 3, etc. The complexity of the formula changes based on the input value used to identify the non-numeric input. A detailed example is provided below.
Suppose your company has expertise in drafting requirements to build two separate systems. Each system (ABC or XYZ) can be designed with a modern or classical design. Classical designs are less complex and require less experienced resources, while modern designs require more seasoned resources and more experienced resources.
You can create a formula in the format of an
if-then statement,
” leveraging numerical values and picklist inputs to define the expected task duration aligned to the resources and design selection criteria.
You can define the duration of compiling a requirement for system XYZ using a modern design to be 6 hours. In the formula, you can identify the selected system as system XYX by selecting
XYZ
in estimation inputs; You can specify that the Stage is Stage II by selecting
II
as the buildout stage in estimation inputs. You are then able to select
Modern
as the picklist value for design style.
User-defined parameters used in the formula builder.
If then statement used in the formula builder.
Estimation inputs on the Estimate Template, add selections for system, stage, and design style as shown below.
Estimation inputs added on the Estimate to build the formula.
The formula example displayed provides users the ability to have the effort formula executed on the estimate template based upon the variable inputs on the estimation inputs of the estimate.
By selecting the user-defined parameters for the ABC system, Stage III, and complexity level complex, you enter
50
as the number of requirements. Then you see that the number of requirements is multiplied by 6 to get the task duration.
Effort duration calculations are displayed on the effort tab of the Estimate. Because all of the input variables for the task align to
Activity Group - 2 XYX - Level II - Modern
, effort calculations for that activity group are provided, while calculations for Activity Group 1 are not provided in this example.
This is an example of how using formulas within formula builder enables you to make calculations based exclusively on variables you select on the Estimation inputs section of an estimate.
Estimate Duration calculations
In addition to viewing the total task duration for each activity group, activity, and task calculated on the Effort tab, you can also view the expected duration for each resource assigned to the task by visiting the resources tab.
When you see a link with the number of resources assigned to a task, and you click the link, it will display the resources that have been assigned to the task and the expected duration for each resource.
View Resources tab and the number of resources assigned to each Task.
When you view the estimated duration for each resource, you are also able to edit the estimated duration by clicking in the effort % cell and editing the expected duration for each resource.
Expand the Resources tab to view/add resources and edit resource effort %.
Where an “if-then” statement may pertain to multiple activity groups, activities, or tasks, in the examples above, only the relevant activity group is populated.
In the figure above, you will see that there was no effort value populated for
Activity Group 1 ABC - Stage I - Classic
because the variables used in estimation inputs displayed in the figure above did not pertain to the
“If then statement”
that would have created an effort value for the WBS.

Schedule Overview
Effective project scheduling considers both the duration and sequence of tasks. This allows you to create service quotes that accurately reflect the project scope, resource needs, and realistic timelines.
There are two primary scheduling approaches:
Top-Down Scheduling
: Ideal for projects with a fixed deadline. You determine the resource requirements needed to meet that deadline.
Bottom-Up Scheduling
: Ideal for projects with a set amount of resources. You estimate a realistic project timeline based on those resource constraints.
Duration
:
Here's how scheduling impacts project duration, illustrated with contrasting approaches:
Bottom-Up Example
: The analysis phase requires an estimated 600 hours of work. This is based on the specific tasks involved, like gathering requirements and creating documentation. The system calculates the total effort based on the complexity and scope of these tasks.
Top-Down Example
: Using the same 600-hour estimate, top-down scheduling focuses on spreading this effort over a specific timeframe, say 4 weeks. The system distributes the 600 hours across those 4 weeks, allocating a set number of hours per week to meet the deadline.
Sequence
:
Project phases can be sequenced in two ways:
Sequential
: Phases must begin only after the previous phase is complete. This applies to tasks with dependencies, like web development, where design finalization precedes development.
Non-Sequential
: Certain phases can be done concurrently, optimizing the overall timeline. This applies to independent tasks, like content creation for a website, which can happen while the design is finalized.
Provus now supports top-down scheduling, providing more flexibility for your project planning.
Bottom-Up Schedule
The bottom-up schedule is determined by the service's setup. If the project duration method is not set to "Custom" (which is the default setting), the project will follow a bottom-up scheduling approach. Within this approach, you have two options:
Carry Over Hours: You can choose to carry over the hours from the previous activity group to the next one.
Do Not Carry Over Hours: Alternatively, you can opt not to carry over the hours, keeping each activity group’s hours separate.
These options allow you to tailor how time is allocated and managed across different activity groups within the project.
Top-Down Schedule
In an estimate-based quote system, you can define the project phases and their durations. The quote system automatically allocates effort across phases according to the specified timeline, ensuring each phase receives the necessary resources.
Here's a breakdown of how the process works:
Phases
: Projects are divided into phases or Activity Groups (AG), such as Analysis, Design, Implementation, etc.
Effort Estimation
: For each phase, the customer provides an estimated effort in hours, distributed over the phase duration.
Automatic Allocation
: The system allocates resources and effort automatically, populating a schedule that distributes effort evenly across the available weeks.
Start Date Shifts
: If the start date of a project changes, the schedule automatically adjusts to maintain continuity.
The waterfall scheduling method ensures that each phase is completed sequentially, while the non-waterfall scheduling method allows for more flexibility.
Waterfall Method Scheduling
The waterfall method is a linear approach where phases follow each other in a predefined order. Here's how it's structured for the given scenario:
Service 1 Start Date
: 4th August 2024
Phases
:
Analysis
: 2 weeks
Design
: 4 weeks
Implementation
: 2 weeks
The allocation for each phase considers the total effort required, dividing it equally across the specified duration.
Waterfall Method Steps
:
Specify Start Date
: The project begins on the specified start date.
Define Phases and Duration
: Each phase is assigned a duration in weeks.
Calculate Effort Allocation
: Total effort hours are evenly distributed across the weeks in each phase.
Generate Schedule
: The schedule displays the start and end dates for each phase, along with the weekly effort allocation.
Here's how the scheduling looks for the given scenario:
Phase
Start Date
End Date
Duration
Total Effort
Effort Per Week
Analysis
4th August
17th August
2 weeks
140 hours
70 hours
Design
18th August
14th September
4 weeks
200 hours
50 hours
Implementation
15th September
28th September
2 weeks
100 hours
50 hours
Analysis Phase
: Begins on 4th August 2024, and runs for 2 weeks, with a total effort of 140 hours, distributed as 70 hours per week.
Design Phase
: Begins immediately after the analysis phase, from 18th August 2024 to 14th September 2024, with a total effort of 200 hours split into 50 hours per week.
Implementation Phase
: Starts after the design phase, from 15th September 2024 to 28th September 2024, with a total effort of 100 hours, or 50 hours per week.
Service Master Setup
You can specify the Activity Group duration only when the services
Project Duration
Method is set to “
Custom”
when you create a service.
For more information, refer to -
https://docs.provusinc.com/docs/april-2024#project-schedule
Duration
As an admin user, you can specify the duration for an activity group on the estimate template. This process allows you to customize how long each activity group is planned to take within your project's estimate, ensuring accurate and tailored project timelines.
To specify a duration for the activity group:
Navigate to the Estimate Template page
and then click
Add/edit activity groups
.
The
Add/edit activity groups
dialog opens. You will see the
Duration (Weeks)
field next to the
Name
field.
Enter the duration of the activity group and click
Save
.
Start Date Reference:
You can create a quote from an estimate with schedule details specified for an activity group.
You can select the Timeline Segment by navigating to
Estimate Template
>
Related
>
Activity Groups
>
Activity Group Template Name
>
Details
.
This enables you to create a quote with the activity groups' dependencies. When you create an estimate/quote with the Start Date Offset (Weeks) details of activity groups, the Quote grid shows the service and activity groups quote sections as below:
If Start Date Reference = Predecessor End Date
Activity group Start Date = Previous activity group in sequence + Start Date Offset (weeks).
If Start Date Reference = Service Start Date:
The Activity group starts at the Service Start Date.
Start Date Offset:
Start Date Offset is the number of weeks added to a reference date to determine the start date of an activity or task. It allows flexible scheduling by accounting for dependencies and lead times between activities.
You can edit the Duration, Start Date Reference, and Start Date Offset on the estimate or quote.
Behavior with a 2-level section Hierarchy
You can create a quote from an estimate with service and activity group hierarchy. This allows you to create a quote with a two-level hierarchy. This feature is behind the beta feature flag “
Enable: Two Level Hierarchy On Quote Grid
.”
For a single service or multi-service quote from an estimate, when you configure the section, you see two levels of hierarchy (Service Section> Activity Group Section) on the quote grid. You can view the 2-level hierarchy wherever the quote grid is visible i.e. Labor Pricing subtab under the Price tab, and the Resource allocation and Price sections of the Quote summary tab.
Labor Pricing
subtab under the
Price
tab:
Resource allocation

Allocate Resources
When creating an estimate template, you can assign resources to a task using the Add/edit resources tab. When you open this tab, you can assign more than one resource to a task. You are also able to allocate the percentage of time each resource will be allocated to the calculated or input task duration.
To add multiple resources to a task:
On the Estimate Template, click the
Add/Edit resources
button.
The Add/edit resources window opens.
Add a Single Resource
You can add a single
Resource Role
to the task and allocate
Effort %
to the resource.
Add Multiple Resources
You can add multiple resources to a task and distribute the effort percentage between the resources.
Add a
Resource Role
to the task and allocate
Effort %
to the resource.
Click the
Add row (+)
button to add a new resource.
Enter the
Resource Role
name, add
Effort %
, and click the
Save
button.
Allocate Effort to Resources
In the example above, the Effort% for each resource is set as 60% for the Business Analyst, 20% for the Product Manager, and 20% for the QA Lead.
The
Total
equals the sum of the Effort %. The value is recalculated if you change or delete a value in the Effort %.
Effort allocation is an important component of the formula builder.
Effort allocation using a Static value
:
Multiple Resources:
You can allocate a static effort to a task on an estimate template with multiple resources assigned to the task on the estimate template. This enables you to distribute the appropriate numerical effort duration to each resource on the task.
As an example, when you assign the task
Document Analysis
a static duration of 50 hours in the estimate template as viewed below:
When you return to the estimate template and click on the button
Add/edit resources,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for each resource on the estimate template. On the top of the screen, you will see the
Total Task Effort
is
50 hours
.
If you add a Business Analyst, a Product Manager, and a QA Lead and assign each resource an effort value of 20, 10, and 10, respectively, you will note the total effort value of the three resources is 50 hours which is equal to the total effort defined on the top of the screen.
Single Resource
:
You can allocate a static effort to a task on an estimate template with a single resource assigned to the task on the estimate template.
As an example, when you assign the task
Resource Analysis
a static duration of 44 hours in the estimate template as viewed below:
When you return to the estimate template and click on the button
Add/edit resources,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for each resource on the estimate template. On the top of the screen, you will see the
Total Task Effort
is
44
hours.
When you create an Estimate, on the
Resources
tab of the Estimate, you can view the
Effort
calculated for the single resource with
Effort %
as
100.
Effort allocation using Formula based calculations:
Multiple Resources:
You can define a formula to calculate the task duration on an estimate template with multiple resources assigned to the task.
When you return to the Estimate template and click on the button
Add/edit resources,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for each resource on the Estimate template.
If you add a Business Analyst, a Product Manager, and a QA Lead and assign each resource an
Effort %
of 60, 20, and 20, respectively, you will note the total effort % of the three resources is 100.
When you create an Estimate and add parameter values using the estimation inputs tabs, the task duration is calculated as per the formula defined in the formula builder.
For example, if you enter 45 hours as an input value for the
Documents
parameter in the Estimation Inputs tab, the total task duration will be calculated as 45 * 10 = 450 hours, as defined in the formula builder.
On the
Resources
tab of the Estimate, you can view the
Effort
calculated for the multiple resources based on the
Effort %
allocated to each.
60% of 450 = 270 hours are assigned to the Business Analyst.
20% of 450 = 90 hours are assigned to the Product Manager.
20% of 450 = 90 hours are assigned to the QA Lead.
Single Resource:
You can define a formula to calculate the task duration on an Estimate template with a single resource assigned to the task.
When you return to the Estimate template and click on the button
Add/edit resources,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for the resource on the Estimate template. As there is only one resource assigned to the task, the Effort % allocated to the resource is 100.
When you create an Estimate and add parameter values using the estimation inputs tabs, the task duration is calculated as per the formula defined in the formula builder.
For example, if you check the
Additional Resource
parameter checkbox on the Estimation Inputs tab of the Estimate, and the checked value for the Additional Resource checkbox is set as 200, the effort value is calculated as 200 + 20, as defined in the formula builder.

Calculate Effort for Tasks
After you have created the tasks, the next step is to assign effort values to each task in the estimate template.
Add or Edit Input Parameters
You can calculate the effort value for a task in the following two ways:
Using a Static Value
Using a Formula
Using a Static Value for Effort
You can allocate a static numeric value to define effort for a task on an estimate template.
As shown below, you can assign a static duration of
50 hours
to a task in the Define task duration formula window:
Using Formula when the Effort is Dependent on a Variable
You can use the following types of variables in the formula:
Standard Parameters
User-Defined Parameters
Standard Parameters
When you create an estimate template, the Total effort of the Activity Group and Activity can also be used as input parameters when calculating task durations. Parameters created from the Activity Group and Activity are known as standard parameters.
When you are on the formula builder, you will see the Activity Group and Activity standard parameters as selection options where you can select these as input variables that can be added directly into a formula on the formula builder. This will be demonstrated later in this document.
Activity Group
Standard parameters for Activity Group:
Activity
Standard parameters for Activity:
User-Defined Parameters
Estimation parameters are the
User-defined
parameters defined on the estimate template.
Estimation parameters will incorporate inputs to be used in determining the level of effort for a task. These parameters may include the identification of inputs such as:
Number of users
Number of documents
Number of Diagrams
Training sessions
Applications in use
Required licenses
Estimation parameters can be added and customized specifically related to the needs of your business.
When you add or edit an Estimation parameter, you can define it according to an expected variable or calculation that will be required.
You can also define the scope of estimation parameters that can be helpful for accurately estimating costs. This feature allows you to limit the estimation input parameters for task duration formula definition and to capture it on the estimate.  You can define the scope of the estimation parameters at the following levels:
Global
: Global estimation parameters are those that apply to all Services and Activity Groups.
Service Specific
: Service-specific estimation parameters are those that apply to a particular service. For example, if you are estimating the cost of providing services, you might have service-specific parameters related to the cost of project scope discovery, kickoff, implementation, testing, etc.
Activity Group specific
: Activity group specific estimation parameters are those that apply to a group of related activities. These are referred to as Standard Parameters at the activity group level.
As an example, if the number of users logged in to the system determines the effort of the task, you can create an Estimation parameter, “number of users,” and it becomes a user-defined input parameter that can be used in the Formula builder.
To add or edit the estimation parameters:
Click the
Add/edit Estimation parameters
button on the estimate template.
The Define estimation parameters page opens.
Click the Add row icon (
+
) to add a new parameter.
The
Service
field is a search field and, by default, displays the “Global” value. Click in the Service field to see a dropdown list of unique services linked to the estimate.
The
Activity Group
field is a search field and is by default empty and read-only if the Service field value is “Global.” When the Service field value is not “Global,” and you click inside the Activity Group field, you will see a list of all Activity groups for the selected service. From the dropdown list, Select the
Activity Group
name.
Enter the
Parameter Name
, the required
Hashtag
reference designated by (#brieflowercasedescription), the
Estimation Question/Guidance,
and the
Data Type
for each estimation parameter, and click the
Save
button.
The Data Types available are:
Number
Tiers
Picklists
Checkbox
To enter the values for Tiers, Picklists, and Checkbox data type, click the
Add values
icon for each. You will notice that when an effort value is assigned to a task, it is the number of hours required to complete the task based on the corresponding tier, picklist, or checkbox attributes selected.
Define the effort value for the Tiers data type parameter.
Define the effort value for the Picklists data type parameter.
Define the duration, if checked, for the Checkbox data type parameter.
To add resources to tasks, refer to
Identify and Allocate Resources to Tasks
.
Using Formula Builder
The formula builder is modeled in the estimate template. When you create an estimate, you can define the formula that will be used to calculate the task duration. The validity and accuracy of the formula are important when defining the projected level of effort required for a task. User defined parameters and standard parameters can be included as inputs to a formula within the framework of the formula builder. You also have the option to enter a static value (numeric entry) directly into the formula builder field.
This section explains how to use the formula builder.
To use the formula builder:
On the Estimate Templates page, click the
Add/Edit task Parameters
button.
The Task parameters page opens.
On the Task parameters page, enter a
Name
for the task parameter, such as Doc Analysis, User Activation, etc., describing the task parameter.
Enter a
Guidance
question (optional) related to the work being performed. The guidance field can be populated (but is not required) to assist you in understanding the scope of actions to be performed when defining the level of effort for a task.
When you populate the guidance field on the Estimation parameter, it will automatically flow through to the Estimation Inputs tab of the estimate and can be used as a reference when you define specific values to be assigned to the parameter and included in the formula builder. If the scope of the project changes from inception, you can capture updates to guidance directly on the estimate.
Click the
Estimate duration
button to open the Define task duration formula window.
Inputs for Formula Builder
Parameters used in the Formula Builder
On the Define task duration formula window, you can see the following three parameter types for selection:
System generated standard parameters for each
Activity Group
created on the Estimate Template. These standard parameters are referred to by the same name as the corresponding Activity Group in the formula builder.
System generated standard parameters for each
Activity
created on the Estimate Template. These standard parameters are referred to by the same name as the corresponding Activity in the formula builder.
User-defined
parameters created using the
Add/edit Estimation parameters
on the estimate template.
These user defined parameters are referred to by the same name in the formula builder.
Using Standard Parameters in Formula Builder
When calculating the level of effort for an Activity Group or Task, the level of effort for all child activities rolls up to the Activity Group or Activity standard parameter. You can use standard parameters within the formula builder when a separate task relies upon the level of effort calculated for the standard parameter.
As an example, you have created the following 3 Activity Groups/Activities/Tasks on the Estimate Template (also displayed in the estimate tree below):
Requirements Documentation/Requirements Doc/Requirement Analysis
Module Design/Module Architecture/Design
PM Oversight/PM Oversight/Project Manager Oversight
You can see these Activity Groups and Activities as standard parameters in the formula builder as selection options.
When you have defined task duration formulas and calculated effort durations that will roll up to the Activity Group and Activity levels for the activity group (1 Requirements Documentation) and the activity (2.1 Module Architecture), the calculated durations for the activity group and activity can be used as inputs for a task in a separate independent Activity Group or Activity.
When you create the following Activity Group, Activity, and Task in the Estimate Tree (see estimate tree example above):
3 PM Oversight (Activity Group)
3.1 PM Oversight (Activity)
3.1.1. Project Manager Oversight (Task)
You can use the calculated durations of previously calculated Activity Groups and/or Activities as inputs to calculate the duration of a separate task.   For example, to calculate the duration of Task 3.1.1 Project Manager oversight, you can define the following formula using standard parameters in the formula builder:
When you create an Estimate, the task duration for the
Project Manager Oversight
task is populated based on the above formula.
The task duration for the task project manager oversight will be calculated based on the rolled-up values for the Activity Group standard parameter “Requirements Documentation” and the Activity standard parameter “Module Architecture,” as shown below:
Operators Used in the Formula Builder
The formula builder allows you to use binary arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and parentheses to create more complex formulas. You can use these operators to perform numerical data calculations or the results of other functions you have created within the formula builder. Note that the order of operations matters when using these operators, so you may need to use parentheses to ensure that calculations are performed in the correct order.
Functions Used in the Formula Builder
The formula builder provides an extensive library of pre-built functions that you can use to create more complex formulas. These functions can perform various operations on your data, including mathematical calculations, date and time manipulation, string manipulation, and more.
An example of how formulas, picklists, tiers, and checkboxes can be used in calculating task durations is included in the
Appendix
.
Provus has the ability to support multiple formula types.
Some examples of commonly used functions in formula builders include:
IF: returns one value if a condition is true and another value if it is false.
AVERAGE: returns the average of a range of numbers.
SWITCH: provides an alternative to using multiple if...else statements when you have multiple conditions to check.
MIN: returns the minimum value from a set of values.
MAX: returns the maximum value from a set of values.
By using these pre-built functions, you can save time and effort when creating complex formulas since you do not have to write all of the code yourself.
Formula Based Calculations
The formula builder is modeled in the estimate template. When you create an estimate, you can define the formula that will be used to calculate the task duration. Navigate to the Define task duration formula page for the task by clicking
Add/edit task parameters
>
Estimate Duration
.
Select the parameter from the
Activity Group/Activity/User-defined
dropdown and create the required formula in the
Task Duration Formula
field.
Examples of simple formulas to calculate a task duration are as follows:
When your user defined parameter is No. of Documents or Documents, and it takes 4 hours to review each document, you can create a formula such as this to estimate the time required for document review.
Documents * 4
When your defined user parameter is No. of Users or users, and it takes 10 hours to activate and train users, you can create a formula such as
Users * 10
Validation Checks in the Formula Builder
You will get validation errors for the following:
Misspelled parameter name
Invalid value
Incorrect Syntax
Incorrect Function name
Unsupported Operator
For example,
If the parameter name is unrecognized, you will get a formula evaluation error as follows:
If you enter an invalid value in the formula builder, you will get a formula evaluation error message as shown below:
Static Effort Allocation
You can allocate a static effort to a task on an estimate template with multiple resources assigned to the task on the estimate template. This enables you to distribute the appropriate numerical effort duration to each resource on the task.
As an example, when you assign the task
Review Documents
a static duration of 90 hours in the estimate template as viewed below:
When you return to the estimate template and click on the button
Add/edit resources,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for each resource on the estimate template. On the top of the screen, you will see the
Total Task Effort
is
90 hours
.
When you add a Requirements Analyst and Data Analyst and assign each resource an effort value of 45 hours, you will note the total effort value of the two resources is 90 hours which is equal to the total effort defined on the top of the screen.
If you were to assign each resource an effort value of 49 and 40 hours, respectively, and attempt to save the values, you would see an error message in red text that states, “Total must be 90.”
Create an Estimate and Complete the Formula Builder Calculations
You can create an Estimate from the estimate template for which you have modeled the formula.
To create a new Estimate:
On the Estimate Template, click the
New Estimate
button.
Review Scope Tab
Guidance and Assumptions
On the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab of the
Scope
tab, you can rename, view, or edit the Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks. You can also deselect Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks from being included in future quotes while keeping them in the estimate.
To remove specific items to be included in the quote, uncheck the
Include
box next to the line item. When you uncheck at any parent level, then all child items in that tree node will be unchecked, and they will not be included in the Quote.
Add Estimation Inputs to the Estimate
The estimation inputs tab of the estimate allows you to populate values for the user-defined parameters identified on the estimation template.
Suppose you enter a guidance reference for a line item on an Estimation parameter on the estimate template. In that case, the guidance question will flow through to the Estimation inputs tab of the estimate, so you will have a reference to the type of data you will enter as a value or checkbox while defining the inputs.
To add values to parameters:
On the
Estimation Inputs
subtab of the
Scope
tab, enter the values for the parameters and click the
Save
button.
Calculation of the task duration will be made on the Estimate when variables are assigned using Estimation inputs.
You can view the calculated effort for each task on the
Effort
tab of the Estimate.
View Effort Calculations
Calculation of the task duration will be made on the Estimate when variables are assigned using Estimation inputs.
Consider you have four tasks defined on the Estimate Template, as shown below:
Each task has an added task parameter with a different data type:
Documents -
Number
data type
Diagrams -
Tiers
data type
Complexity -
Picklist
data type
Additional Resource -
Checkbox
data type
The level of effort for task duration is able to be set in the Add values field of the Estimation parameters screen for data types that are “Tiers,” “Picklist,” or “Checkbox.” When the data type is “Number,” the value for the Task parameter will be captured as a formula or static value in the
Add/edit task parameters
window, where you can enter a formula or value.
Calculate task effort duration for
Number
data type
The task duration for the Document Analysis task is calculated based on the static value or formula entered in the formula builder.
For example, when you enter the Documents parameter value on the Estimation Inputs tab, the effort value is calculated as defined in the Estimate Template.
The task duration is calculated as the number of documents multiplied by 4, representing a level of effort of 4 hours required to review each document.
Calculate task effort duration for Tiers/Picklists/Checkbox data type
For tiers, picklists, and checkbox data types, you don’t need to add values in the Define task duration formula. You can add values to these parameters using
Add/edit estimation parameters
on the Estimate Template, as mentioned previously.
When you create an Estimate, you can view the calculated effort for each task on the
Effort
tab of the Estimate.
Effort Tab
When you create an Estimate, you can view the
Calculated Effort
and
Total Effort
for each task on the
Effort
tab of the Estimate. You can also adjust the effort value, if required, and mention the reason for the adjustment. The total effort will be re-calculated based on the effort adjustment.
Split Resources and Specify Availability on the Estimate
You can split the resources and specify their availability for an Activity Group on the Estimate Template. This means breaking down the required resources and determining how long each resource will be needed. This can help ensure that all the necessary resources are available when needed.
On an Estimate, click the
Resource Summary
button next corresponding to the activity group to split the resources and specify availability.
The resource summary for the specific Activity Group opens.
Click the dropdown list corresponding to the Resource name to select the option as shown below:
Specify the availability percentage of a resource and click
Save
.
You can split the effort amongst the resources as needed and click
Save
.
Scope Tab
The three subtabs,
Select Services
,
Estimation Inputs
, and the
Work Breakdown Structure
on the
Scope
tab of the Estimate, allow you to view the scope information without navigating to other screens.
Select Services subtab
:
The
Select Services
subtab on the Scope tab displays a list of services in a single service and a multi-service Estimate/Quote.
On the Select Services subtab, you can view the following fields:
Sequence
: Displays sequence number for each service row. This is a Read-Only field.
Service
: Displays the list of services linked to the activity groups from the estimate template. This is a Read-Only field.
Include
: Checkbox field with a default value as checked.
If unchecked, the service and child activity groups are marked as not applicable and removed from the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
If selected back, the service and child activity groups are marked as applicable and added to the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
Start Date
: The service start date.
Estimation Inputs subtab
:
The
Estimation Inputs
subtab on the Scope tab displays the Estimation Parameters along with the original estimation guidance questions used when creating the parameters.
The Estimation Inputs subtab is a crucial part of the estimation process because it allows you to input specific values used in the formula builder to calculate the estimate.
If the estimation parameter requires a numeric value, you can enter that value directly into the value field on the screen.
If the parameter uses a picklist value, you can select the appropriate value from the dropdown menu.
If the parameter uses tier values, you can enter the input value relevant to your task, and the system will define the level of effort.
If you have used a checkbox and assigned a numerical value to the level of effort when a checkbox is applied, then the checkbox value will be applied to the level of effort calculation.
Work Breakdown Structure subtab
:
The
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab on the Scope tab displays the Service/Activity Group/Activity/Task along with the
Guidance and Assumptions
columns. These columns display the text inherited from the Guidance and Assumption columns for each row of the estimate template for the corresponding activity group, activity, and task.
Resources Tab
The Resources tab on the Estimate displays two subtabs:
Task Resource Mapping
and
Resources Mix
.
The
Task Resource Mapping
subtab displays the resources allocated to specific tasks, and these allocated resources are also shown on the Preferred Resources subtab. If only one resource is allocated for a task, you can see the resource role name as a hyperlink next to the task. If multiple resources are allocated for a task, you will see the number of resources as a hyperlink next to the task.
The
Resources Mix
subtab allows you to efficiently manage the resource mix. By making changes to the resources and confirming them, you can update the resource assignments, rate card attributes, and pricing information for tasks within the estimate.

Identify Services
When your organization is responsible for creating serviced based proposals and quotes, the first step for creating a quote is typically to identify the services that are required to complete the job. This involves understanding the specific needs and requirements of the client or customer and then determining which services are necessary to fulfill those needs.
After you have identified the services required and estimated the cost, you can then create a quote that outlines the specific services to be provided and the associated costs.
You can create a multi-service framework that supports both single service estimates and multi-service quotes while maintaining consistency and efficiency in your sales process.
When you create a new estimate template, you can select the service required from the list of available services or add a new service to the template. You will be able to see the service details on the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template.
Create or Manage the WBS Hierarchy
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a project management tool that breaks down a large project into smaller individual components. These smaller components enhance the ability of project teams to manage each component of a deliverable effectively.
Within the framework of the Provus quoting tool, the estimate template is created in a tree structure with the hierarchy of Services, Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks. The estimation tree serves as the WBS for creating estimates and quotes.
Services
A service refers to a type of work or benefit that you offer to your customers. Services may include Professional services, Asset-based services, and Consulting services, depending on the industry and the nature of the business.
Add a new Service
This section explains how to create a new service.
You can create a service in the following two ways:
While creating an Estimate Template
By using the Add/remove services button
While Creating an Estimate Template:
To create a new service:
On the home page, select the
Estimate Templates
tab.
Click the
New
button.
The
New Estimate Template
page opens.
On the New Estimate Template page, click in the
Service
field. The Service field is a search field and displays a list of available services.
In the Service field, select the
+ New Product
option. The
New Product
page opens.
Select the
Service
radio button. The
New Product: Service
page opens.
On the New Product: Service window, enter the mandatory product information and click
Save
. A new service template is created. You can see the
Service Template Name
and the
Service
name as hyperlinks on the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template.
By using the Add/remove services button:
After creating the estimate template, you have the option to add a service to it using the "Add/remove services" button.
To add a new service:
On the Estimate Template page, under the Estimate Template Designer tab, click
Add/remove services
.
The
Add/remove services
page opens.
On the Add/remove services page, search and select the service that you want to add.
Click the
+
icon to add more than one service and click
Save
.
A new service template is created. You can see the
Service Template Name
and the
Service
name as hyperlinks on the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template.
Edit or Delete a Service
This section explains how to edit or delete a service.
To edit or delete a service:
On the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template, select the dropdown list corresponding to the service you want to edit or delete. You will see two menu options -
Edit
and
Delete
.
To Edit a service:
Click the
Edit
option to edit the service details. The Edit service template page opens. The edit page displays the service template number.
On the Edit service template page, make the required changes and click the
Save
button.
To delete a service:
Click the Delete option to delete the service.
Delete service template warning message is displayed.
Click the
Delete
button to delete the service template or click the
Cancel
button to cancel the action.
View the service nodes on the Estimate Template
You can view the service nodes in the activity tree of an estimate template containing multiple services.
This feature enhances the usability and transparency of the estimate template by providing a comprehensive view of the service nodes and their corresponding activity groups. It helps you better understand the structure and organization of the estimate, enabling you to make more informed decisions or modifications as needed.
When you open the estimate template, by default, all service nodes are collapsed. When you expand a service, any other expanded service will collapse.
All Services Collapsed
:
Service Node Expanded
:
The Service node becomes the parent node for each of the activity groups that are linked to the service in the estimate template using the Create/edit activity groups dialog.
The Service name is a read-only field. You can expand or collapse the service node using the > icon. You will not see the service node in the case of a single service.
When a single service is used on an estimate template, the single service name is displayed under the Service header on the estimate template.
When multiple services are selected for the template, you will see the number of services that are associated with the estimate template under the Service header.
Activity Group
An activity group is a group of all the related activities and serves as the parent of activities and tasks. All information relating to children of the parent activity group will roll up as a subset of the data related to the parent.
This section explains how to create activity groups.
To create an activity group:
On the Estimate Templates page, under the Estimate Template Designer tab, click
Create/edit activity groups
corresponding to the service.
The Activity Groups window opens.
On the Activity Groups window, the
Service
field displays a value for the first activity group entry that is automatically set to the service value from the estimate template header. This default value is also applied to any subsequently added activity group rows.
On the Activity Groups window, enter a
Name
for the activity group, and the reference content for
Guidance
and
Assumptions
. Guidance and Assumptions fields are not mandatory; however, they are extremely useful in capturing scoping information related to each item in the estimation tree.
Click the
+
icon to add more than one activity group and click
Save
.
You can see the
Expand All
/
Collapse All
button on the Activity Group tree row. Clicking on this label will expand or collapse all the activities and tasks under it. The button label dynamically changes to
Collapse All
only if all activities and tasks are visible after expanding.
Activity Group expanded using Expand All
:
Note:
When you expand an activity group, any other previously expanded activity group will automatically collapse.
When you create a new activity group or copy/paste an activity group, all the expanded services will collapse.
The new activity group is visible only when you expand the related service.
When you click the ">" option for expanding an activity group, you can view only activities and not tasks.
When you add or edit an activity using Add/Edit activities, the activity group will be expanded to show only activities and not tasks.
Activity
An activity is a measurable and observable process that typically involves the use of resources such as time, materials, and human effort. Each activity serves as a parent of different tasks. This section explains how to add activity to the activity group.
To add an activity to an activity Group:
On the Estimate Templates page, click the
Add/edit activities
button corresponding to the activity group.
The Activities window opens.
On the Activities window, enter a
Name
for the activity, the reference content for
Guidance
, and
Assumptions
, if applicable.
Click the
+
icon to add more than one activity and click
Save
.
Tasks
A task is a specific action or set of actions that need to be completed to accomplish an activity. This section explains how to add tasks to an activity.
To add a task to an activity:
On the Estimate Templates page, under the Estimate Template Designer tab, click
Expand All
corresponding to the activity group, and then click the
Add/edit tasks
corresponding to the activity.
The Tasks window opens.
On the Tasks window, enter a
Name
for the task, the reference content for
Guidance
, and
Assumptions,
if applicable.
Click the
+
icon to add more than one task and click
Save
.
Guidance and Assumptions
:
Guidance and assumptions fields are optional fields that can be used to capture information related to project scope. While these are not required fields, data captured here can provide valuable insight into your specific customer’s requirements for an engagement.
The Guidance field can be used to define questions to be asked to the user to determine the project scope.
Examples of Guidance:
How many languages need to be supported?
How many users will require access?
What is the expected number of training sessions needed?
The Assumptions field is used to record customer-specific answers to guidance questions.
Examples of Assumptions:
Support must exist in 5 languages.
25 users require system access.
There will be 3 training sessions.
Note:
Guidance and Assumptions defined at the task level are specifically associated with the task duration. Tasks serve as the basis for defining resource effort to complete specific tasks associated with the corresponding parent activity and activity group.
The WBS tree displayed in the estimate template below illustrates the hierarchy of Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks:
To add resources to a task, refer to
Identify and Allocate Resources to Tasks

As an Estimate Template Manager, you can select secondary rate cards for your estimate template, allowing the template to support multiple rate cards. This feature is behind the beta flag - “
Enable: Multi-Rate Card Estimate Templates
.”
This section explains how to add additional rate cards to an estimate template.
To add secondary rates cards:
On the Home page, select the
Estimate Templates
tab. You will see a list of Estimate Templates.
From the estimate templates list, click the Estimate Template Name hyperlink to which you want to add the secondary rate cards.
The Estimate Template page opens. You see a new button labeled "
Add/remove secondary rate cards
".
On the Estimate Template page, click
Add/remove secondary rate cards
.
The
Add/remove secondary rate cards
dialog opens.
On the Add/remove secondary rate cards dialog, click the
+
icon to add a new rate card. A new row is added.
The Secondary Rate Card is an editable search combo-box field.
In the Secondary Rate Card field, search and select any active rate cards configured in the org, except the below:
Rate Card(Primary) of the estimate template.
Secondary rate cards already added in the list.
Select the rate card and click
Save
, the system performs the following validations:
If all the roles in the secondary rate card are present in the Primary Rate Card.
If validation fails, an error message is displayed:
"Resource roles in this rate card do not match with those in the rate card: '{0}'"
, where "{0}" is the Primary Rate Card on the Estimate Template.
If all the attribute group fields (including custom attributes) of the selected rate card match the attribute group of the Primary Rate Card.
If validation fails, an error message is displayed:
"Attributes from the Attribute Group of the rate card do not match with those from the rate card: '{0}'"
, where "{0}" is the Primary Rate Card on the Estimate Template.
The secondary rate cards are saved to the estimate template if all validations pass.

Introduction
This page provides a consolidated list of monthly release notes for the
Provus
Services Quoting Platform. Users can refer to this page at regular intervals to stay informed about announcements regarding new features and updates related to the product.
What’s New
Release - June 2025
Feature Updates
Description
Quote
Sales Managers can now view a summary of services within the Summary tab of the estimate quote. This enhancement enables users to analyze quote pricing by service.
The Provus admin can define a formula for calculating values using
hashtag parameters
. This allows them to establish dynamic formulas based on estimation parameters, so that changes to these parameters do not require a full quote refresh.
Users can now update the resource attributes directly from the
Resource Mix
tab. Previously, only the resource could be selected, and the system automatically assigned the attributes. This update provides greater control and flexibility in resource configuration.
Quote Managers can view a detailed
Quote Item Price Breakdown
to improve transparency and build confidence in quote accuracy and pricing validity.
Pricing
The Provus admin can configure tiered pricing for rate card items so that pricing can dynamically adjust based on value ranges and attribute-driven conditions.

The admin can now also set default values for estimation input parameters (
Tiers
and
Picklist
type) on an estimate template. When a quote is created from that template, these default values are automatically applied to the corresponding parameters in the quote. This ensures consistency and saves time by reducing the need for manual input.
Add-Ons
The Provus admin can hide or show columns on the Add-Ons grid, so that they can control what users can view on the grid.

Release: Rate Card Change on Direct Quote
.”
On the Edit scenario/quote dialog, you can change the rate card. You will be able to see only global and customer-specific rate cards.
If the rate card is not active—either marked as Active = No or if the entered service start date is outside the effective and expiration dates of the rate card—an error message will appear.
After the rate card is updated on the quote, the base price and base cost for add-ons and resource quote items present in the new rate card are adjusted accordingly.
For quote items where matching resources and add-ons exist, the resource allocation, Quote Item Discount, and Resource Role Name are retained. Price/cost override are not retained when the rate card is changed.
After updating the rate card on a quote, any quote items (add-ons and resources) with mismatched rate card attributes between the old and new rate cards are automatically highlighted.
You will see a warning message:
"Highlighted resources/add-ons are not available in the selected rate card. Delete all highlighted items?"
If you confirm,
all highlighted quote items are removed.
You can remove or edit resources and remove add-ons that do not belong to the new rate card.
After you remove all the incompatible items, the highlighting is removed and the warning toast message disappears.
After the rate card is updated on the quote:
If there are resources or add-ons that do not exist in the new rate card, you will see the following changes:
All Provus actions will be in read-only mode.
A warning icon with a tooltip will be displayed next to each action.
The "Additional Details" link will be in read-only mode.

The admin can configure the custom metadata:

Quote - Support for Custom Fields on Estimate Based Quote Creation
Ability to View a Custom Field Value on Create Services Quote wizard
As a sales user, you can view a custom (non-Provus) field on the Create Services wizard steps. This is behind the beta flag “

.”
The Provus admin can configure a custom field on the Create Services Quote Wizard through custom metadata:
Create Service Quote Detail
. For configuration information, refer to

This feature is behind the beta feature flag: “
Configurable Volume Discount Tiers
.”
When you navigate to the
View and apply price adjustments
dialog and select the
Labor Disc - By Volume
, you can see and define the 4 volume tiers as shown below:
Ability to Apply Tiered or Volume Discounts for Quote level Aggregation Type
As a Provus user, you can apply volume or tiered-based discounts using the quote-level aggregation type so that you can perform discounting according to your needs. The tiered discount feature is controlled by the product feature flag “
Enable Tiered Discount
” in the Pricing Settings of Custom Metadata.
When
Enable Tiered Discount
and
Enable Volume Discount
from the Pricing Settings custom metadata is set as On:
If you navigate to the  Adjust pricing dialog of the quote and apply the volume discount, and if there are any existing discounts of a different type, you will see a message “This will remove the already applied discounts, are you sure you want to continue?”
If you confirm, then the existing discounts are removed and the new discount is applied as follows:
If Aggregation Metric = Labor Revenue, the weighted average discount % is calculated with a precision of 5 decimals based on the Labor Revenue and applied to all the line items.
If Aggregation Metric = Person (Labor Unit), the weighted average discount % is calculated with a precision of 5 decimals based on the Labor unit and applied to all the line items.
You can view the calculated discount amount in the quote line item price breakdown in the Vol Discount field and the Quote pricing is recalculated.
Apply Quote-Level Discounts Using Absolute Discount Amounts
As a quote manager, you can enter a discount amount as a Quote Level discount so that you can provide an evenly rounded quote amount to a customer.

Enable: Quote Level Discount Amount
.”

Allocated Disc %
value.
The
Allocated Disc Amt
is calculated as (Allocated Disc %*Total Amount)/100.

On Apply, discount value and quote pricing are saved (it will consider it as Total Quoted Amount override).

Read Only User Support
If you want to provide read-only access to Provus to certain users, now you can use Provus read-only access capability. Read-only users will be able to view the quote but will not be able to edit or delete it.
The read-only license is provisioned to users, allowing them to open Provus, navigate to a quote, and view all the information on the quote without making any updates. Some users with this license also have the role of approvers, enabling them to approve quotes.
This is managed through a permission set group called
"ReadOnlyUser"
, which is part of the Provus package.
The ReadOnlyUser permission set group has the following permissions sets:
View Estimates
View Estimate Templates
View Proposals
View Quotes
The following tabs are configured as read-only through the ReadOnlyUser permission set group:
Quote Details
Scope Tab
Effort Tab
Resources Tab
Price Tab
Salesforce actions configured as custom won't be read-only.
Platform User Support
Provus is an application on the Salesforce platform that requires its own license. To use Provus, users must also have a Salesforce platform license.
If you are using a CRM other than Salesforce such as NetSuite or want to use limited Salesforce capabilities, you must have Salesforce platform license in addition to the Provus license. This is necessary for accessing both Provus and Salesforce functionalities. A standard platform user should have a Salesforce Platform User License, SalesUserPlatform permission set group, and a Standard Platform User profile.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the January 2024 release:
Quote
View Quote Summary for Non-Estimate Quotes
As a sales user, you can view the most important quote information when you open a non-estimate quote. This eliminates the need for you to navigate to other tabs.
On opening a non-estimate quote, you can see the
Quote Summary
tab displayed by default. On the right side of the Quote Summary tab, you will see the existing tabs specifically for non-estimate quotes. If you click the
View Additional Details
link and then navigate back, you will return to the Quote Summary tab.
View Resource Allocation on the Quote Summary tab
As a sales user, you can view
Resource Allocation
on the
Quote Summary
tab of the quote page so that you have access to resources and effort right when you open the quote.
After opening a non-estimate quote, if the quote does not have any resource added, you see the existing
Add Resources
dialog to add resources. This functionality also applies to quotes created using the
Create Services Quote
wizard.
You can see the
Resource Allocation
widget on the
Quote Summary
tab:
The Resource Allocation widget displays the existing quote grid from
Labor Pricing
, and you can view the following modifications:
Base Price, Disc %, Quoted Amount, Quoted Price, Base Cost, Total Cost, and Margin % columns are hidden.
The Total Amount row is hidden.
All existing actions and right-click actions are applicable for both estimate and non-estimate quotes and these actions update the Price widget and Labor Pricing grids.
The Provus admin can hide the Resource Allocation widget based on custom permission without affecting any other widgets or sub-tabs.
When effort is allocated/changed in time periods, pricing is updated in the following areas:
Labor Pricing sub-tab on Quote
Price Summary widget on Quote Summary
Total Amount on Quote header and Scenario cards
Calculated Quote Amount on the Adjust Pricing dialog
The Resource Allocation is retained on:
Cloned Quote created using the
Create Clone
action
Scenario created using the
Create Scenario
action
Primary Quote created using the
Mark Primary
action
Quote Template created using the
Saved as Template
action
Quote created from
Quote Template
View Preferred Resources on the Quote Summary tab
As a sales user, you can view and edit the preferred resources on the Quote Summary tab. This gives you access to crucial information right when you navigate to the quote.
The existing
Preferred Resources
subtab under the
Resources
tab is renamed to
Resource Mix
.
For Estimated based Quote, the
Resource Mix
widget on the
Quote Summary
displays details from the existing Preferred Resources subtab:
The Provus admin can hide the widget based on existing Preferred Resources custom permission.
You can inline edit the resource attributes.
If you make any changes and save, the selected resource displays in the quote grid with accurate pricing and cost information, and the quote header information, as well as the quote summary are updated accordingly.
View Pricing Information on the Quote Summary tab
As a sales user, you can view the summary of pricing information on the Quote Summary tab (for estimate and non-estimate based quotes), so that you do not have to navigate to any other tab for pricing information.
For Estimated based Quote, the
Price
widget appears below the
Resource Allocation
widget on the
Quote Summary
tab and displays details from the existing
Labor Pricing
tab:
The price widget gets automatically updated when you update the labor pricing. The Provus admin can hide the price widget based on custom permission (without hiding any of the other widgets/sub-tabs).
The Pricing Summary is retained on the following:
Cloned Quote created using the
Create Clone
action
Scenario created using the
Create Scenario
action
Primary Quote created using the
Mark Primary
action
Quote Template created using the
Saved as Template
action
Quote created from the
Quote Template
The Provus admin can also hide the following fields on the Price widget on the Quote Summary tab (not on Labor Pricing):
Row
Total Amount
Column
Base Price
Disc %
Quoted Price
Quoted Amount
Base Cost
Total Cost
Margin%
<Time Period Group Total>
View Grand Total for Total Person Units and Quoted Amount
In addition to periods and period group totals, you can now view the grand total of the
Total Person units
and the
Quoted Amount
on the Resource Allocation and Price widget on the Quote Summary tab.
Ability to Search a Task/Resource in the Task Resource Mapping tab of a Quote
As a sales user, you can search for tasks in the Task Resource Mapping tab using the
Search
field to view the subset of tasks you want to view.
On the
Resources
tab of the Quote, under the
Task Resource Mapping
subtab, you can see a
Search
field.
The search field supports token based search.
The search is not case-sensitive.
You can search with multiple words and each word in the search phrase needs to match in the
Tasks
or
Resources
column.
The output displays rows that match the search criteria. If there are no matching records, no data will appear. To clear the search, click the
x
icon in the search box.
View Add-ons on Quote Summary
As a sales user, you can now view Add-ons on Quote Summary so that you have access to add-ons information when you open a quote. When you open a non-estimate quote or an estimate quote, you will see the
Add-ons
widget on the
Quote Summary
tab.
The Provus admin can hide the Add-Ons widget based on a custom permission.
Scope - Work Breakdown Structure
View Resource Column on Work Breakdown Structure for Standard Tasks
As a sales user, you can view the resources assigned to a task from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This allows you to see the Task, Resource, and Effort on WBS.
On the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab of the
Scope
tab, you can see a new column called
Resource
.
In the Resource column, for all standard tasks, you can see the following hyperlinks:
Resource Name: If a single resource is assigned to the task.
<count of> resources: If more than one resource is assigned to the task.
Clicking on the resource hyperlink directs you to the existing
View/edit resources
dialog. From there, you can add, remove, or modify one or more resources and then save the changes. The resource role hyperlink on the task automatically adjusts to reflect the modifications made.
These changes are then mirrored in the Task Resource Mapping, Quote grid, Preferred Resource, and Summaries.
Ability to Hide Service Tree of Not Included Services on Work Breakdown Structure
As a sales user, when you are on the work breakdown structure of a quote, the service tree of not included services is hidden so that you won't see unnecessary information.
When you navigate to the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab of the
Scope
tab on a quote, you won't see a service tree of services that are not included in the quote. However, if a service is included in the quote, the service tree will be shown, even if any of the Activity Group/Activity/Task of that service is excluded from the service/quote.
The following quote has only one service included in the quote:
The WBS subtab shows only the included service:
View Effort and Additional Details on Work Breakdown Structure Subtab of Quote
As a sales user, you can view and update the effort on the work breakdown structure tab details effectively, so you can define the effort on the WBS without navigating to the effort tab.
On the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab of the estimate or quote, you will see the following changes:
Renamed “Include in Quote” to “Include”
Removed Guidance column from UI
You see a new field
Effort(hrs)
with the following properties:
On Task row level, Effort(hrs) is:
Inline Editable Number field with 2 decimal places and is a Required field.
Read-only and greyed out when Include = “False”
By default, it shows the Total Effort from the Effort Tab
Shows value as “0” if the effort is not defined for the task with an indicator
On Activity row level Effort(hrs) is:
Readonly number field with 2 decimal places
By default, it shows the Total Effort from the Effort Tab
On the Activity Group level Effort(hrs) is
Readonly number field with 2 decimal places
By default, it shows the Total Effort from the Effort Tab
On Service level Effort(hrs) is:
Readonly number field with 2 decimal places
By default, it shows the Total Effort from the Effort Tab
If you click
Save
and If the Task row level Effort(hrs) is Empty, you will see a field level error message “Complete this field”
If the updated task row level Effort(hrs) is not equal to the Calculated Effort of the task on the Effort tab, then save Effort Adjustment as Effort(hrs) - Calculated Effort and Effort(hrs) = Total Effort. Sync to quote is triggered if an estimate is linked to a quote.
Ability to Apply Availability and Split Resources from Work Breakdown Structure Subtab
As a sales user, you can apply availability and split resources from WBS so that you don't need to navigate to the Effort tab.
When you are on the Work Breakdown Structure subtab, you will see a hamburger menu corresponding to the standard Activity Group.
This menu opens the existing resource allocation page, displaying options for specifying availability and splitting resources for those resources. Both the
Availability
and
Split Resources
dialogs in the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab and the
Effort
tab will display the same values for Availability % and Resource split.

Ability to Select Quote Type on the Create Services Quote Wizard
As a sales user, you can create different types of quotes using the
Create Services Quote
wizard. This way, you won't need to click on various buttons for each type of quote.
This functionality becomes available through the beta feature called "New Create Services Quote Wizard."
After clicking the
Create Services Quote
button on the
Opportunity
or
Quote
list page, the first step in the wizard displays a "Select Quote Type" section.
The
Create Quote Type
section displays the following two options:
Staffing Services Quote
Project Based Services Quote
The Provus admin can hide any of these radio button options from the users. If all options are hidden, the wizard will skip this step and move directly to the next one. If only one option remains visible, it will be automatically selected. Additionally, the admin can set any of the radio button options as the default for the users.
Ability to Create Staffing Services Quote using Create Services Quote wizard
As a sales user, you can specify the staffing quote parameters using the Create Services Quote wizard.
This enables you to create a staffing services quote. The feature becomes active when the beta feature flag “New create services quote wizard” is switched ON.
When you choose the
Staffing Services Quote
option in the first step of the
Create Services Quote
wizard from the Opportunity or Quote list page and proceed to the next step, the
Specify quote parameters
page appears.
The Specify quote parameters page displays the following fields:
Description
Quote Date
Service Start Date
Service End Date
Rate Card
Account
Opportunity
Section Hierarchy
Practice
Group
Proposal
Service
Labor Units
Time Periods Alignment
Time Periods
Time Periods Group Method
The
Previous
Button takes you back to Step 1 of the wizard. If you return to the second step without altering the quote type option, the field values remain unchanged. Clicking the
Create Quote
button generates a Staffing services quote (not linked to any estimate).
Ability to Create Project Based Services Quote using Create Services Quote wizard
As a sales user, you can create a project based quote using the
Create Services Quote
wizard.
This capability allows you to generate a quote using the estimate template. The feature becomes active when the beta feature flag “New create services quote wizard” is switched ON.
Choose the
Project Based Services
Quote option in the first step of the
Create Services Quote
wizard from the Opportunity or Quote list page and proceed to the next step.
Step 2: Define the quote parameters
Step 3: Choose services to include in the quote
Step 4: Confirm Service Selection
In step 4, clicking the "Create Quote(s)" button, generates one or multiple service quotes (linked to the estimate). The
Previous
Button allows you to navigate back to the previous wizard step.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the December 2023 release:
Quote
View More Records on the Estimation Inputs widget
As a sales user, you can view more records on the estimation inputs widget in Quote Summary. The
Estimation Inputs
is the first widget on the
Quote Summary
tab.
On the Quote Summary tab, when you access the Estimation Inputs widget, you'll see that it displays up to 9 estimation inputs meeting specific criteria without requiring you to scroll within the widget.
However, if the number of records exceeds 9, a widget-level scroll becomes available for seamless browsing.
Ability to Hide Time Period Group row from the Quote Grid
As a sales user, you will not see the Time Period Group row. This will allow you to view the total amount per year/month/quarter/week even if the schedule columns are hidden. The Provus Admin can control the visibility of the Time Period Group rows.
If either the Period or Period Group is hidden, the Period Group header row won't appear.
The Period Group header row will only be displayed if both the Period and Period Group are set as visible.
View Additional Fields on Popup for Scenarios
As a sales user, you can see a popover when you hover over the scenario or quote card. This enables you to view more details about the scenario/quote.
For a multi-scenario quote, the info icon is displayed next to the Quote value.
When you hover over the icon, a popover will appear, displaying additional fields. The popover will close automatically when you move away from the info icon or if you manually close it using the 'x' button, following the standard Salesforce behavior.
Additionally, the Quote Name link is removed.
View all Provus Standard Actions When Quote Status is Approved
As a sales user, you can view all the standard quote actions according to the quote's status by default. This allows you to utilize all available actions.
By default, you can see the following actions when a quote is in the "Approved" status:
Adjust Pricing
Create Scenario
Make Primary
Save as Template
Create Rate Card
Invite to Collaborate
Rate Conversion Factors
Submit for Approval
Clone Quote
Additionally, the Provus admin can hide necessary actions based on the visibility filter criteria specified in the custom metadata.
Ability to Navigate to Additional Details tabs on a Locked Quote
As a sales user, you can navigate between Provus tabs and
Additional Details tabs (Details, Related, Custom)
for locked quotes so that you can view full quote information even when the quote is locked.
For quotes created from estimates or directly from the quotes tab, if the quote is locked (for example, in an approval process with a status like
Pending Approva
l or
Approved
), you can:
Use the
View
Additional Details
link to navigate to Additional Details.
Use the
Back
link to navigate to Provus tabs from Additional Details.
Ability to Hide Quote Schedule Columns only for Estimate based Quotes or Non-Estimate based Quotes
As a sales user, you always see schedule columns on the quote grid for non-estimate based quotes.
This allows you to add hours/headcount on the quote. Periods, period groups, total row, and total units row are visible only when the quote doesn’t have a linked estimate.
The Provus admin can configure the visibility of the schedule columns specifically for estimate-based quotes or non-estimate-based quotes (using expressions like "EstimateId == Null" in the JSON).
Ability to Hide Add-ons Pricing tab for Non-Estimate based Quotes
As a Provus admin, you can hide the Add-ons pricing tab for non-estimate based quotes, so that you do not show information that is not relevant.
By default, the
Add-ons Pricing
tab is always visible.
Add-ons Pricing
tab Hidden:
Quote Wizard
Ability to set the Default Values to the Reference Fields on the Create Services Quote wizard
The Provus admin can set the default values of the header fields so that the sales user does not have to select the fields explicitly.
As a Provus admin user, you can default/configure the following field types shown on the Create Services Quote wizard step 1:
Text Fields:
Description
Date Field:
Service Start Date
Reference Field:
Location
Users will see the "Name" field value of the referenced record. This configuration applies to creating services quotes from the opportunity and the quote list page.
Pricing
View Quoted Amount before Discount and Discount Amount on Adjust pricing
As a sales user, you can now view the amount before the discount and the discount amount on the Adjust pricing dialog header. This lets you understand how the total quoted amount is calculated.
On the Adjust Pricing dialog, you can see the following fields:
The
Calculated Quote Amount
is renamed to
Quote Amount (Before Disc
).
Quote Amount (Before Disc)
= Aggregated Quoted Amount of all the quote items - Aggregated discount amount of all the quote items
Discount Amount
: This is a read-only currency field. The discount amount is calculated as the Aggregate discount amount of all the quote items in all the discount cases below:
Quote level discount
Location discount
Volume discount
Line item level discount
Total Quoted Amount
: This field displays currency with 2 decimal places. You can edit this field inline.
Ability to Hide Price Related Fields from Labor Pricing
As a Provus admin, you can hide the price-related columns on Labor Pricing so that the sales user does not see unnecessary fields.
You can show/hide the following fields:
Base Price
Disc %
Total Person Hours/Days/Weeks/Months/Quarters
Quoted Price
Quoted Amount
Base Cost
Total Cost
Margin%
Example:
Base Price
and
Quoted Price
visible:
Base Price
and
Quoted Price
hidden:
You can also hide the 'Show/Hide Pricing Attributes' option in the labor pricing menu.
Discount Calculation after Total Quoted Amount Override
As a sales user, if you override the Total Quoted Amount, then the discount is applied to the quote items accordingly. This ensures that both the quote and its items reflect the adjustment accurately.
When you edit or override the
Total Quoted Amount
value and apply changes in the
Adjust Pricing
dialog box and if there are any existing discounts already applied (such as quote level, labor disc volume, or labor disc location), a confirmation message will pop up as shown below:
If you confirm the changes:
All existing discounts, including volume, location discounts, quote level discounts, and line item discounts/markups, are removed.
The
Quote level discount
is applied as follows:
Allocated Discount %
is calculated as: (
Quote Amount
(Before Discount) -
Total Quoted Amount
) /
Quote Amount
(Before Discount).
This
Allocated Discount %
is applied to all line items to calculate their
Quoted Amount
.
The
Discount Amoun
t reflects the aggregated discount amount of all quote line items.
Rounding Adjustment
is computed as: (
Quote Amount
(Before Discount) -
Discount Amount
) -
Total Quoted Amount
.
However, if you cancel the action, the
Total Quoted Amount
will revert to its previous value, and all other discounts and existing rounding adjustments (Volume, location discount, Quote level discount, line item discount/markup) will remain unchanged.
Rounding Adjustments Removal after Base Price Override
As a sales user, if you perform a base price override after the total amount override, the rounding adjustments will be removed. This ensures that the amounts for the quote and its items accurately reflect the applied adjustments.
Consider the following quote where
Total Quoted Amount
is overridden (through the Adjust Pricing dialog header):
Now, if you attempt to override the base price on the quote grid, a confirmation message will appear as shown below:
If you click
Continue
and confirm, the system executes the following steps:
If the Rounding Adjustment equals 0 or holds any value, the
Total Quoted Amount
is overridden.
If the Rounding Adjustment is Null, then the
Total Quoted Amount
is not overridden.
If you click
Cancel
, the
Base Price
reverts to its previous amount.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the November 2023 release:
Quote
View adjusted price and cost details in the quote price breakdown after resource price or cost override
As a sales user, when you override or adjust the resource price on the quote item, the quote price breakdown shows the adjusted amounts. This is to ensure that the quote price breakdown displays correct pricing information.
This feature is supported by the beta feature flag called "Enable Price and Cost Override."
Base Price
Override
Example:
On the following quote, the Base Price for the Junior Sales Resource is $62.50.
If you click the
Quoted Amount (USD)
field hyperlink, you will see two new price fields -
Original Base Amt
and
Base Amt Adjustment
before the
Base Amt
field. These fields display period-level aggregated values for
Original Base Amt
and
Base Amt Adjustment
for that quote item.
Before Base Price Override
:
Suppose you override the Resource Base Price of the quote item and change it to $80.
If you click the Quoted Amount (USD) hyperlink and view the quote price breakdown, you will see the recalculated values.
After Base Price Override
:
Original Base Amt
is calculated as (Rate Card Base Price) multiplied by Person hours for each line item and aggregated at the period level.
Base Amt Adjustment
is calculated as (Base Amt - Original Base Amt) for each line item and aggregated at the period level.
Base Cost
Override
Example:
On the following quote, the Base Cost for the Junior Sales Resource is $62.50.
If you click the
Quoted Amount (USD)
field hyperlink, you will see two new cost fields -
Original Total Cost
and
Total Cost Adjustment
before the
Total Cost
field. These fields display period-level aggregated values for
Original Total Cost
and
Total Cost Adjustment
for that quote item.
Before Base Cost Override
:
Suppose you override the Base Cost of the quote item and change it to $82.
If you click the Quoted Amount (USD) hyperlink and view the quote price breakdown, you will see the recalculated values.
After Base Cost Override
:
Original Total Cost
is calculated as (Rate Card Base Cost) multiplied by Person hours for each line item and aggregated at the period, period group, and quote level.
Total Cost Adjustment
is calculated as (Total Cost - Original Total Cost) for each line item and aggregated at the period level.
The total row for these new fields displays the aggregated values for all the periods for that quote item.
Ability to Hide Schedule Columns on Quote grid based on User Persona
As a sales user, you do not want to see the columns on the quote grid that are not relevant to you so that you do not see unnecessary information.
The Provus admin is able to control the visibility of the below quote grid columns based on the user persona:
Labor Pricing Schedule columns
Period and Period Group columns
Total Person <Months> and Total Amount (USD) rows
Configuring the Json in
Custom Metadata Types
>
Provus Component Configuration
>
Quote Ancillaries
will show the following fields/columns on the quote grid:
Period
Period Group
Total person units row
Total amount row
The Provus admin can mute the permission from any of the permission set group. Users with the custom permissions are only able to see the fields. This custom permission shows/hides the columns for the quotes linked to an estimate. These changes are retained when the push upgrade happens.
View Quote Scenarios as side-by-side cards
As a sales user, you can see multiple scenarios side by side, ensuring a consistent and convenient way to view a summary of all scenarios.
You can see the selected card with a blue border. A maximum of three quote cards will be visible on the screen at any given time, including the Primary one. When you select a card, you will see the quote/scenario specific details.
If there are more than three cards, you will see a scroll bar. The Primary scenario is displayed first (on the leftmost) in side-by-side cards.
View 'Primary' label on side-by-side multi-scenario cards
As a sales user, you can see the multiple scenarios side by side so that you can view a summary of all scenarios consistently.
For multi-scenario quotes, when you mark a scenario as Primary, you see the scenario with the Primary label.
View Quote Summary on the Quote landing page
As a sales user, you can view and modify
Estimation Inputs
and
Services
directly from the Quote landing page, ensuring immediate access to critical information upon landing on the Quote page. This functionality is activated through a beta feature flag named "Push Upgrade."
When you navigate to the
Quotes
tab and select a specific quote, you will see the
Quote Summary
tab. This tab is visible for:
Quotes created from estimates
Quotes created using the 'Create Services Quote' wizard
The Provus admin can hide the
Quote Summary
tab based on permissions.
If the Quote is created without an estimate, you will not see the
Estimation Inputs
widget on the Quote Summary.
If the Quote is created from a single service estimate template, you will not see the
Services
widget on the Quote Summary.
This feature allows the inclusion of both Standard Salesforce and custom Provus LWC Components.
View Select Services on the Quote Summary
As a sales user, you can view and edit the
Services
from the Quote landing page so that you have access to key information right when you land on the Quote.
Under the Quote Summary tab, you can see the
Services
widget showing information from the existing 'Select Services' sub-tab, including the In-line edit for 'Include in Quote' and 'Start Date'.
You will not see the Services widget for the following cases:
Quotes created from a single service estimate template
Quotes created without an estimate
Provus admin can also hide the widget based on permission.
Services Widget without any edits:
Services Widget after edits:
Clicking
Save
triggers the sync-to-quote action, while clicking
Cancel
will cancel the action.
View Estimation Inputs on the Quote Summary
As a sales user, you can view and edit the
Estimation Inputs
from the Quote landing page so that you have access to key information right when you land on the Quote.
You can see the
Estimation Inputs
widget showing information from the existing 'Select Services' sub-tab along with:
Search functionality
In-line edit for value
Estimation inputs that belong to:
Selected services
Global
The Provus admin can also hide the widget based on permission.
The Estimation Inputs widget is visible as the first widget on the Quote Summary tab if the Services widget is hidden or not present.
Estimation Inputs widget before edits:
Estimation Inputs widget after edits:
Clicking
Save
triggers the sync-to-quote action, while clicking
Cancel
will cancel the action.
Ability to Hide a Custom Header Field
As a Sales admin, you can remove fields from custom metadata so that you can control the fields that are shown up on the custom header.
On the custom
Datatable Column Config (Managed)
page, you can see the
Active
checkbox for each field. By default, the
Active
checkbox is selected. When you clear the
Active
checkbox for a specific field, the field will not be displayed in the custom header, regardless of its sequence.
For example, if you want to hide the
Discount Amount
field from the custom header.
On the
Datatable Column Config (Managed)
page, clear the
Active
checkbox for that field as shown below:
The
Discount Amount
field is now hidden on the custom header.
On the custom header, you can display the fields with Active as selected in the order of sequence. The following first four fields on the custom header have
Active
checkbox selected and are non-editable:
Quote Name
Description
Total Amount
Margin %
Auto-sync Changes on the Preferred Resources tab
As a Sales User, if you make any changes in the preferred resources tab, then those are auto synced with the quote and estimate.
When you save the changes to the rate card attributes (like location, skill, band, etc.) for a resource role on the
Preferred Resources
tab, the changes are auto synced to the estimate and quote.
For example, the skill level for the resource Release Engineer is L2 and Base Price is $18.74 as shown in the below quote.
Suppose you change the skill level for resource Release engineer to L1 navigating to
Resources
>
Preferred Resources
tab and save the changes.
After you save the changes, you can see that the following field updates:
Quote order item prices are updated, and the Base Price, Base Cost, Quoted Price, Quoted Amount, and Margin % of the corresponding order item on the quote grid are updated.
Aggregated prices at the period level and period group level are updated on the quote grid.
Quote pricing is recalculated, and the quote header reflects the updated prices.
The quote price breakdown and the adjust pricing dialog header also display the updated prices.
Pricing summaries on the Summaries tab are updated, and named ranges are updated accordingly.
Resource location discounts are updated, and the adjust pricing function now reflects the latest list of locations. Discounts are recalculated based on the updated list of resource locations.
Finally, resources are updated, and the task resource mapping on the resource tab is updated, along with the resource summary dialog on the effort tab.
View More Records on the Estimation Inputs widget
As a sales user, you can now view more records on the estimation inputs widget in the Quote Summary.
The Estimation Inputs widget now allows you to view up to nine estimation inputs without the need for a scroll bar. If the number of records exceeds nine, a widget-level scroll bar will appear to help navigate through the additional inputs.
Quote Wizard
View Location selection on the Create Services Quote wizard
As a sales user, you can select a location during the creation of a services quote using the quote wizard.
This allows you to create a quote that is linked to a location.
This feature is supported by the "Enable Location Quoting" Product Feature Flag (not the beta flag)
. By default, the "Enable Location Quoting" flag is set to False.
If the "Enable Location Quoting" is set to True, the step 1 of the Create Services Quote wizard will show the following:
You will see the Location field as an editable optional reference field with search capability.
You can search for and select a location record from the Provus Location Object.
After you create a quote with a selected location using the wizard, you can view the location on the quote header for the new quote created.
Ability to set the Estimate Template Field on Create Services Quote Wizard as Read-only for Single Estimate Template Services
As a sales user, you cannot modify the estimate template during steps 2 and 3 of the service quote creation wizard when using a single estimate template.
When you are working within the Create Services Quote wizard on steps 2 and 3:
The estimate template field will display a value and be set as read-only for services that have only one active estimate template.
Create Services Quote Wizard Step 2:
Create Services Quote Wizard Step 3:
The estimate template field will display a value and be editable for services that have more than one active estimate template.
View Quote page when Quote is successfully created from Create Services Quote wizard
As a Sales user, you want to land on the first Quote page once a quote is created from Create Services Quote wizard so that you can view the details of the quote without any additional click.
When you create a quote using the
Create Services Quote
wizard:
The default landing page of the quote opens automatically.
Existing success messages are not displayed.
Create Services Quote Wizard - Step 1:
Create Services Quote Wizard - Step 2:
Create Services Quote Wizard - Step 3:
After you click
Create Quote(s)
, the default landing page of the quote opens automatically.
Ability to Hide Estimate Template and Service Start Date on Create Services Quote Wizard
As a sales user, you will not see the estimate template or start date column during quote creation from the opportunity.
The Provus admin has the ability to show or hide the following fields:
Estimate Template
field on:
Select services (step 2 of Create Services Quote Wizard)
Confirm service Selection (step 3 of Create Services Quote Wizard)
Start Date
field on:
Confirm service selection (step 3 of Create Services Quote Wizard)

Ability to Show/Hide or Set Fields as Read-only on Create Services Quote wizard
The Provus admin can customize the fields displayed on the Step 1 of the Create Services Quote wizard with the following options:
Show/Hide Fields
: You can choose to display or hide the following fields:
Description
Labor Units
Service Start Date
Time Periods

tab, for
Frequency
and
Price Method
fields:
You will see only the default picklist value set in the object manager.
You will see only the 'active' values in the dropdown, hiding any deactivated values.
Scenario 1
- When default values are set as
Frequency
= “Monthly” and
Price Method
= “Per Head” in the object manager, you will see only the default values in the corresponding fields on the Add-Ons Pricing tab.
Scenario 2
- When the
Frequency
picklist has only ‘Project Start’ and ‘Project End’ as active.
Ability to Hide Add-Ons Fields
As a sales user, you cannot see the fields on the quote grid that are not relevant to you, so that you do not see unnecessary information.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the October 2023 release:
Quote Wizard
Filter Services based on Service Categories and Search Services on Quote Wizard
As a sales user, you can select service categories within the "Create Services Quote” wizard. This allows you to efficiently locate and choose services based on specific service categories aligned with customer requirements.
On step 2 of the "Create Services Quote", you will see the
Filter service categories
as a multi-select filter field.
The field is a search field and displays the text “0 selected," initially.
If you click within the filter field, it displays a list of all available service categories.
Each service category is a checkbox, and you can select one or more service categories.
You can also search within the filter. The search result displays all service categories that match the entered keyword, along with checkboxes.
You can see the
Clear
and
Apply
options:
Clear will clear your selection of service categories and display "0 selected" in the filter.
Apply will apply the selected filter of service categories, but it will only be enabled when you have selected at least one service category.
After you have selected your desired service category values and applied the filter, you can see the list of services that are associated with the selected service categories.
E.g., if you have selected “Software” service category, you will see a list of services associated with Software service category.
The
Filter service categories
field displays the updated count indicating the number of selected categories. E.g.,"1 Selected."
On Step 2 of the wizard, if you select a service that uses a different estimate template than the previously selected services, a notification appears, indicating that this action will create <count> quotes, where <count> represents the number of unique estimate templates.
For example, if you select 2 services with different estimate templates, you will see a notification, “This will create 2 quotes”.
There is a search field available on both Step 2 and Step 3 of the wizard. This is a multi-word search field that filters rows based on search words found in the
Service Category
and
Service
fields. The search function operates effectively even when the filtered list contains more than 100 records.
View Number of Quotes Created Notification on Quote Wizard
On step 2 of the “Create New Quote" wizard, if you select a service that has a different estimate template than the services you previously selected, or if you change the estimate template for a service you had already selected, a notification will appear, indicating that this action will create <count> quotes, where <count> represents the number of unique estimate templates.
Quote
New Quote Creation Wizard from Quote List page
As a sales user, you can create a quote using a wizard from the Quote list page so that you don't need to create an estimate explicitly for quote creation.
You can see a new button on the Quote list page called
Create Services Quote
.
Upon clicking the
Create Services Quote
button on the Quote list page, you will see the Opportunity to Quote wizard.
A Create new quote page opens. If you choose to cancel the operation, you will be navigated back to the Quote list page.
On the
Create new quote
page, the
Account
field is editable and serves as a search field, displaying a list of active accounts. The
Opportunity
field is by default read-only but becomes editable when an Account is selected. It displays a list of opportunities associated with the selected Account.
After successfully creating the quote(s), a success message will appear, indicating, "Quote(s) created successfully," along with a list of the created quotes and their respective links. In case of an error during the quote creation process, an error message will be displayed, stating, "Error occurred during quote creation."
In the event of an error, the system will automatically roll back any created estimates and quotes to their previous state.
If only one quote is created, you will be navigated to the Quote landing page for further actions.
View Custom Tabs on the Quote using the Additional Details Option
As a quote manager, you can see the custom fields/components of the quote when the additional details option is selected.
When you navigate to the Quotes page, you will see 5 Provus tabs -
Price
,
Scope
,
Effort
,
Resources
, and
Summary
. Additionally, you can see the
View Additional Details
link.
After clicking the View Additional Details link, the system displays two Salesforce tabs:
Details
and
Related
. You also notice a
Back
link. Clicking the Back link navigates you back to the Provus tab structure.
You can also view any additional custom tabs that you have created as per your organization’s requirements.
For example, if you have created a
Documents
tab which will show the details of the proposal, you can see the Documents tab next to the Details and Related tab.
For information on how to add custom tabs, the Provus admin can refer to
Add Custom Quote Tabs
Admin Guide.
Ability to Change the Action Button Label on the Quote
As a PS user, you can change the label of any of the Provus actions for Quote. This will allow you to name the actions in a way that is more intuitive to the users of a given organization.

Contingency
tab when you access the

Base Price Override on Quote Item
As a sales user, you can override the resource price on the quote item. This allows you to adjust the resource price per customer needs.
This feature is supported by the beta feature flag "Enable Price and Cost Override."

Rate Card Unit Price
. If you have overridden the Base Price, the overridden price is displayed.
You can edit the Base Price cell of a quote item:
By double-clicking on the cell to enter edit mode.
By selecting the cell and typing in a value.
The following validation occurs when you click off the cell to exit edit mode and attempt to override the original Base Price:
If the value is 0, negative, or not a number, the value is ignored, and the original base price value before the edit was attempted is displayed.
Additionally, if the quote item's Unit Price is not equal to the Rate Card Unit Price, the cell color will change to peach.
If you delete the overridden cell value, the cell value returns to the Rate Card Base Price.
You can modify the overridden cell to a new value as needed. This functionality applies to all quotes, whether the quote is linked to an estimate or not.
If the Rate Card Unit Price changes due to rate card updates, the Unit Price will be reset to the updated Rate Card Unit Price, subject to the existing quote status conditions.
Base Cost Override on Quote Item
As a sales user, you have the ability to override/adjust the resource cost on the quote item. This allows you to tailor the resource cost according to customer needs.
This feature is supported by the beta feature flag "Enable Price and Cost Override."
By default, the
Base Cost
field displays the Rate Card Unit Cost from the quote item.
You can make changes to the Base Cost cell of a quote item:
By double-clicking on the cell to enter edit mode.
By selecting the cell and inputting a value.
The following validation takes place when you click off the cell to exit edit mode and attempt to override the original Base Cost:
If the overridden value is 0, negative, or any other non-numeric character, the value is not saved, and the cell reverts to displaying the original base cost value.
If the Base Cost is not equal to the Rate Card Base Cost, the cell color changes to peach.
If you delete the overridden cell value, the cell value returns to the Rate Card Unit Cost from the rate card.
You also have the capability to modify the overridden cell value to a new value as needed. This functionality applies to all quotes, whether the quote is linked to an estimate or not.
If the Rate Card Base Cost is changed due to rate card updates, the Base Cost will be reset to the updated Rate Card Base Cost, subject to the existing quote status conditions.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the August 2023 release:
Opportunity to Quote Flow - Quote Wizard
You can now create a new multi-services quote(s) from opportunity using the quote wizard.
To create a quote using the quote wizard:
On the Opportunities page, click
Create Services Quote
.
The
Create new quote
page opens.
On the Create new quote page, enter the required details and click
Next
.
The
Select services to be included in the quote
page opens.
On the
Select services to be included in the quote page,
select the services, and click
Next
.
The
Confirm service selection
page opens.
On the Confirm service selection page, click
Create Quote(s)
.
You can view the quote created in the
Quotes
section and the Services in the
Products
section on the Opportunities page
.
Click the Quote Name hyperlink to navigate to the quote and the
Total Amount
field values will be populated.
If there are services from different estimate templates, then the quotes are created for each template.
'Select Services' subtab not visible for a single service estimate template
As a sales user, when you generate an estimate and a quote from a single service estimate template, you won't be able to view the
Select Services
subtab under the
Scope
tab. This intentional feature ensures that you do not encounter an unnecessary blank tab during the process.
When you create an estimate and a quote from an estimate template with a single service, you can see that the
Select Services
subtab is not visible under the
Scope
tab.
Scope tab on Single Service Estimate
:
Scope tab on Single Service Quote
:
Estimate Template - Usability Enhancement
As an estimation manager user, you require efficient management of estimate templates containing thousands of task resource combinations to facilitate working with multi-services estimates.
To streamline the user experience, the following changes are implemented:
Removed the Service, Activity Group, Activity, and Task expand/collapse icons.
Added the
Expand All
/
Collapse All
button on the Activity Group tree row. Clicking on this label will expand or collapse all the activities and tasks under it.
The button label dynamically changes to
Collapse All
only if all activities and tasks are visible after expanding.
All Services Collapsed
:
Service Node Expanded
:
Activity Group expanded using Expand All
:
The following enhancements will significantly improve the usability and performance of managing large estimate templates with multiple services:
When you open the estimate template, by default, all service nodes are collapsed.
When you expand an activity group, any other previously expanded activity group will automatically collapse.
Similarly, when you expand a service, any other expanded service will collapse.
When you create a new activity group or copy/paste an activity group, all the expanded services will collapse.
The new activity group is visible only when you expand the related service.
When you click the ">" option for expanding an activity group, you can view only activities and not tasks.
When you add or edit an activity using
Add/Edit activities
, the activity group will be expanded to show only activities and not tasks.
Ability to Hide COLA based on Product feature flag
Provus provides you with the functionality to enable or disable the COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) feature.
Suppose as a Sales representative if you are working on a multi-year quote and your company does not utilize COLA based price and cost markups.
If the COLA setting is disabled, then you will not be able to view the COLA tab when you open the
Adjust Pricing
dialog on the quote.
By default, the product setting for COLA is
enabled
.
If you click the
Adjust Pricing
button on the quote and navigate to the "View and apply price adjustments" page for a multi-year quote, you can see the COLA tab.
If you click the
Quoted Amount
hyperlink on the quote grid and navigate to the "Review quote item breakdown" page, the
COLA Pass Amt
field will be visible.
Suppose the product setting for COLA is
disabled.
If you click the
Adjust Pricing
button on the quote and navigate to the "View and apply price adjustments" page, you will not see the COLA tab.
If you click the
Quoted Amount
hyperlink on the quote grid and navigate to the "Review quote item breakdown" page, the
COLA Pass Amt
field will not be visible.
COLA will not be applied to the quote or its items, even if there is any COLA master data setup in the organization.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the July 2023 release:
Estimate Template
Support for decimal values for checkbox type estimation parameters
As an estimate template manager, you have the ability to input effort values in decimal format for checkbox-type parameters. This feature allows you to tailor the effort values to suit your specific requirements.
By clicking the
Add/edit task parameters
button on the Estimate Template, you can access the Define task duration formula page for a checkbox-type parameter.
You have the option to enter values in decimal format, allowing precision up to two decimal places.
Search on define estimation parameters on estimate template
As an estimation manager, you require the ability to effectively search and filter records on the Estimation Parameters screen using a type-ahead search feature. This functionality enables you to easily access and view a specific subset of estimation parameters that align with your desired criteria.
When you navigate to the
Define estimation parameters
dialog by clicking the
Add/edit estimation parameters
button on the estimate template, you can see a new Search field.
Define estimation parameters dialog with Search field, Service and Activity Group columns:
Define estimation parameters dialog with filter text in the Search field:
The Search field has the following functionality:
Multiple word search: you can search using multiple words, and the search will filter rows that have matching text in any of the following columns: Service, Activity Group, Parameter Name, and Estimation Question/Guidance.
Token-based search: The search supports token-based functionality, allowing for more refined and specific search queries.
Case-insensitive search: The search is not case sensitive, meaning it will consider matches regardless of letter casing.
All-word match: Each word in the search phrase must exist within each output row. This ensures that every part of the search phrase is found in each resulting record.
To clear the search, you can click the "x" icon within the search box, which will remove the search query and reset the displayed results.
Search in the Formula Builder dropdown Fields
As an estimation manager, you can now search within both standard parameters and user-defined parameters fields in the formula builder. This functionality helps you to easily locate and add the desired parameter to the formula builder.
On the Estimate template click
Add/edit task parameters
->
Estimate Duration
and navigate to the "Define Task Duration Formula" dialog. You will see search functionality in both standard parameters and user-defined parameters fields.
When selecting a field, a dropdown menu will appear with all the values.
If you enter a character in the search field, the parameter names containing the entered keyword will be displayed as search results.
To remove the entire text from the search, click the "X" icon. If you click outside the field without selecting any search result, the search criteria will be automatically cleared.
Once a parameter is selected from the search results, it will be added to the formula builder.
Quote to Opportunity Sync
You now have the capability to link quotes with opportunities. Linking quotes to opportunities helps to streamline the sales process by keeping all relevant information in one place. It allows sales representatives to easily access and manage quotes within the context of specific opportunities.
Link Quotes to Opportunities
You can link an opportunity to quote in the following ways:
In the
Details
tab of the quote, update the Opportunity field to link it to the quote.
When creating a quote, specify the opportunity to establish the link between them.
View Opportunities Page After Linking Quote
After linking a quote to an opportunity, you will see the following sections on the opportunities page:
Products
On the opportunities page, in the products section (referred to as “Opportunity Products”), sales users can now view distinct entries for each service, when multiple service quotes are associated with an opportunity. This ensures accurate representation of services in the opportunity products.
Multiple service quotes linked to an opportunity
:
On the opportunities page, you can see the following information in the
Products
section:
Product
: Displays the service name from the linked service quote's service section.
Quantity
: Shows a quantity of 1.
Sales Price
: Displays the total quoted amount for the service, which is the sum total of the quoted amounts from all quote grid items under the corresponding service section in the quote.
Single service quotes linked to an opportunity
:
On the opportunities page, you can see the following information in the
Products
section:
Product
: Displays the read only service name. This matches with the service linked to the quote, on quote header (quote details page).
Quantity
: Shows a quantity of 1.
Sales Price

Opportunity Product Service Quote section
provides the following information:

Service
: Displays the service name.
Service Quote
: Displays the linked service quote name.
Automatic Update of Opportunity Products with Changes to Linked Quotes
The opportunity products automatically update when the following changes are made to the linked quotes:
Removing the linked opportunity from the service quote removes the opportunity product items for all services from the linked quote.
Linking a service quote to a new opportunity creates opportunity product items for all services in the newly linked opportunity.
Removing a service from the linked service quote (by unchecking the "Include In Quote" flag) removes the opportunity product item for that service.
Adding a service to the linked service quote (by checking the "Include In Quote" flag for a previously disabled service) adds the opportunity product item for that service.
Changing the quoted amount for a linked service in the corresponding service quote's Service section (from the quote's Summary tab) updates the Sales Price field for that service in the opportunity product.
Changing the quoted amount for a linked service quote (for single service quotes) updates the Sales Price field for that service in the opportunity product.
Changing the primary scenario for the linked quote removes the existing linked service quote and adds a new linked service quote, resulting in an update of the opportunity products.
Whenever there is a change in the opportunity products, the Amount on the opportunity header is updated.
To ensure the automatic update of opportunity products with linked quotes, it is necessary to select the appropriate price book on the opportunity. Additionally, the selected price book should contain the services mentioned in the quote.

Provus Quoting Platform undergoes regular updates to add new features and functionality while also removing or deprecating older features to make way for newer and more efficient options. This process helps to ensure that the software remains up-to-date, secure, and user-friendly.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the June 2023 release:
Estimate Template
View the service nodes on the Estimate Template
You can now view the service nodes in the activity tree of an estimate template containing multiple services.
This feature enhances the usability and transparency of the estimate template by providing a comprehensive view of the service nodes and their corresponding activity groups. It helps you better understand the structure and organization of the estimate, enabling you to make more informed decisions or modifications as needed.
The Service node becomes the parent node for each of the activity groups that are linked to the service in the estimate template using the Create/edit activity groups dialog.
The Service name is a read-only field. You can expand or collapse the service node using the > icon. You will not see the service node in the case of a single service.
When a single service is used on an estimate template, the single service name is displayed under the Service header on the estimate template.
When multiple services are selected for the template, you will see the number of services that are associated with the estimate template under the Service header.
Add or Remove Services on the Estimate Template
The ability to add or remove services from the estimate template easily provides you with the flexibility to configure the template according to your customer's specific needs. This feature allows you to customize the estimate and tailor it to the specific services you want to include or exclude in the template.
You can see the Add/remove services button on the estimate template:
When you click the
Add/remove services
button, the Add/remove services page appears. By default, the service selected on the "New Estimate" template pop-ups as the first row.
You can see the following two columns on the Add/remove services page:
Services Column
It is a search and select field where you can search with multiple words and get a list of matching services to select from. If no text is specified in the search, it displays a list of all active services in alphabetical order. Previously selected services do not appear in the search list. You can clear the field by clicking on the 'x' icon on the selected chip.
Actions Column
Clicking the
icon adds a new blank row below the current row.
Clicking the
icon deletes the row. If there is only one row, the delete icon is disabled.
If a service mapped to activity groups is deleted, a confirmation message is shown:
On the Add/remove services page, if you click
Save
and the Service column is blank, an error message is shown as illustrated below:
If the save operation is successful, activity groups mapped to removed services are deleted, and the remaining services are saved on the estimate template.
The service field in the "Create/Edit Activity Groups" dialog shows only the list of services present on the "Add/Edit Services" page.
Scope
Renamed Scope Subtabs
You can now view identifiable names for the Scope subtabs of the Quote and Estimate. The updated names allow you to quickly identify which section of the subtab you need to view and edit.
Scope tab on the Estimate
The Manage Services and Scope Summary subtabs of the Scope tab on the Estimate are renamed
Select Services
and
Work Breakdown Structure,
respectively.
Scope tab on the Quote
The Manage Services and Scope Summary subtabs of the Scope tab on the Quote are renamed as
Select Services
and
Work Breakdown Structure,
respectively.
Manage the Service start date for services on the Estimate or Quote
When creating a service, you are required to provide the Service Start Date. This field cannot be left empty. However, if you do not enter a specific date, the system will automatically set the service start date to be the same as the date when the estimate is created.
As an Estimate Manager, you now have the ability to control and adjust the service start dates within an estimate or a quote. This feature empowers you to create a customized schedule for the services based on your specific requirements and preferences.
On the Select Services sub-tab in the Scope tab of Estimate or Quote, you can see a new editable column,
Start Date
.
You can enter the
Start Date
and click
Save
to save the changes.
You will get validation messages in the following scenarios:
If the Start
Date
is empty for any service.
If the Start
Date
is earlier than the Service Start Date.
The quote grid schedule for the service starts from the Start Date as defined in the Select Services tab.
Usability Enhancement - View the Save and Cancel buttons on the Estimation Inputs Screen without scrolling
To facilitate a seamless user experience, the Save and Cancel buttons are positioned at the bottom of the Estimation Inputs screen of the Quote and the Estimate. This feature enables you to effortlessly select either choice without any additional scrolling required.

- ‘Estimation Inputs’ tab showing ‘Save’ and ‘Cancel’ options when the first parameter is edited:

Quote - ‘Estimation Inputs’ tab showing ‘Save’ and ‘Cancel’ options when a parameter is edited after scrolling down
:
View the Service Nodes on the Work Breakdown Structure Subtab
The
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab on the Scope tab displays the Activity Group/Activity/Task along with the
Guidance and Assumptions
columns. These columns display the text inherited from the Guidance and Assumption columns for each row of the estimate template for the corresponding activity group, activity, and task.
You can edit activity groups, activities, and tasks, identify items you wish to include or exclude in the quote when converting an estimate to a quote, and update the Guidance and Assumptions fields used when assessing the scope of the engagement.
As an estimation manager, you can now view the service nodes in the WBS to know the activity groups associated with the services.
On the Work Breakdown Structure subtab of the Scope tab of estimate or quote, you can see a new Service node with the service name.
The service node becomes the parent node for all the activity groups that are linked to the service in the estimate template using the Create/edit activity groups dialog. The Service name is a read-only field. You can expand/collapse the service node using the > icon. The
Guidance
,
Assumptions,
and
Include in Quote
fields are blank and read-only at the service node level.
Effort
Usability Enhancement - View the Save and Cancel buttons on the Effort Screen without scrolling
To facilitate a seamless user experience, the Save and Cancel buttons are positioned at the bottom of the Effort screen of the Quote and the Estimate. This feature enables you to effortlessly select either choice without any additional scrolling required.
If you edit Effort Adjustment, Adjustment Reason on the Effort page, the Save and Cancel buttons will appear and remain locked in the lower section of the Effort Screen, providing you with quick access to confirm or cancel the action without the need for any further scrolling.

:
Resource Summary at the Activity Group within a Service
You can now view the Resource summary at the Activity Group level. This feature allows you to define the ‘Specify availability’ and ‘Split resource by Activity Group within the Service.
Resources
View the Resources tab on the Quote
You can view a
Resources
tab on a quote created from an estimate. The Resources tab allows you to view and edit resources, similar to the Resources tab on the Estimate.
If you change the resource allocation on the Estimate, the changes are automatically synced to the quote. When the quote is updated, the associated estimate is also updated automatically.
When you navigate to the Resources tab within an Estimate or Quote, you will find two subtabs:
Task Resource Mapping
and
Preferred Resources
. The Task Resource Mapping subtab displays the resources allocated to specific tasks, and these allocated resources are also shown on the Preferred Resources subtab.
Resources Subtabs on the estimate and quote
As an Estimate Manager, you can get a comprehensive view of aggregated resources along with their rate card attributes across all tasks in the Preferred Resources tab. Its purpose is to enable you to efficiently handle the resource mix for the quote generated from the estimate.
Estimate - Task Resource Mapping subtab
:
Quote - Task Resource Mapping subtab
Estimate - Preferred Resources subtab
:
Quote - Preferred Resources subtab
:
If you decide to make any changes to the resources, the system will prompt you with a confirmation message before you save the changes. This step ensures that you are aware of the modifications you are about to make.
Estimate -Confirmation action when resource attributes are populated, and changes are saved
:
Clicking the
Continue
button will save the resource role preferences in the estimate.
Quote - Confirmation action when resource attributes are populated, and changes are saved
:
Clicking the
Continue
button will save the resource role preferences in the quote.
After you confirm the changes, the system will execute the Sync to Quote behavior. This process involves updating the resource assignments to tasks, as well as the rate card attributes and pricing information based on the new rate card items displayed on the quote grid.
The Preferred Resources tab allows you to efficiently manage the resource mix for quotes generated from estimates. By making changes to the resources and confirming them, you can update the resource assignments, rate card attributes, and pricing information for tasks within the quote.
Default Preferred Resources for Changes on Estimate
As an estimation manager, you can view the default rate card attributes in preferred resources when a resource is added in the estimate or the quote. This feature allows you to view the resource details and pricing information on the quote as soon as the resource is added.
If you allocate a new resource role or change an existing resource role to a task in the Resources tab:
The values for the rate card attributes are automatically selected in the Preferred Resources dialog for the newly added resource.
If an attribute has a null value, the null value is displayed as the default value in the Preferred Resources dialog.
For example, you allocate a new resource, “Data Tech 2,” to task T2:
The system selects a set of rate card attributes from the database, specifically the first set returned, and automatically pre-populates the attributes in the Preferred Resources tab.
Quote
Automatically Sync Estimate to Quote
As a Provus user, you can see the changes made to an estimate reflected in the quote automatically.
If a quote has been generated from an estimate, when you make and save any of the following changes to the estimate, the system will automatically sync the estimate to the quote:
Scope Tab of the Estimate
:
Estimation Input: If you add or edit any estimation inputs in the scope tab, the changes will be reflected in the quote.
Work Breakdown Structure: If you include any information in the scope summary, such as guidance, assumptions, or details for activity groups, activities, or tasks, those changes will be synced to the quote.
For example, suppose you change one or more of the estimation input values in the Estimation Inputs tab on the Estimate and click
Save
.
The changes are automatically synced to the quote, and you will see the following message:
You will now see the changes made are reflected in the quote.
Resources Tab of the Estimate
:
Task-Resources Mapping: If you add or edit any resources in the "View/Edit Resources" section and map them to tasks, the changes will be updated in the quote.
For example, if you change the Effort% allocation for the resources as shown below and click
Save
, the changes are automatically synced to the quote.
Estimate - Resources before edit
:
Estimate - Resources after edit
:
You will now see the resource changes are reflected in the quote.
Effort Tab of the Estimate
:
Estimated Duration: If you enter or modify the estimated duration for any task in the effort tab, the updated duration will be synchronized with the quote.
As an example, if you make an
Effort Adjustment
for Task T1 on the Estimate and click
Save
, the change is automatically synced to the quote.
Estimate - Effort Adjustment
:
You will now see the Effort changes are reflected in the quote.
Similarly, if you modify the 'Split resource' or 'Specify availability' in the resource summary on the estimate, the changes are automatically synched to the quote.
Click the Resource Summary icon to open the 'Split resource' or 'Specify availability’ options.
Modify Specify availability and/or Split resource and click
Save.
By automatically syncing these changes, the system ensures that the quote remains up-to-date with any modifications made to the estimate, maintaining consistency between the two.
Different Service Start Dates by Service and related Quote Grid Behavior
As a Quoting Manager, you can allocate resources independently for each service. This means you can plan and manage schedules and resources for each service separately, without them being interconnected or dependent on each other. This feature provides flexibility and allows you to efficiently allocate and optimize resources based on the specific needs of each service.
For a multi-service quote created from an estimate, each service will start on its designated Start Date, regardless of whether the resource in the service has a partial or full allocation in another service for the same duration.
Each service operates independently and follows a waterfall model, meaning the resource availability is assumed to be full unless specified otherwise. If a resource is split between multiple services, each split portion is treated as an independent resource within that particular service.
To calculate the end date for the quote screen, the above method is used to determine the Service End Date for each service in the quote. This calculated Service End Date is then used to determine the number of periods and period groups in the quote grid.
Deprecated Features
Provus Quoting Platform undergoes regular updates to add new features and functionality while also removing or deprecating older features to make way for newer and more efficient options. This process helps to ensure that the software remains up-to-date, secure, and user-friendly.
The following table shows a list of the deprecated Features and Functionalities:

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the May 2023 release:
Usability Improvements
View Scope Information on the Quote or Estimate
You can now see a
Scope
tab with sub-tabs
Manage Services
,
Estimation Inputs
, and
Scope Summary
on the Quote and Estimate. The Scope tab allows you to navigate directly to the scope information you want to view.
Scope tab on Estimate:
Scope tab on Quote:
View Effort Information Directly on Quote or Estimate
You can now view an
Effort
tab on the Quote or Estimate. The existing
Estimator
tab on the estimate and the
Estimate
tab on the quote are renamed to
Effort
.
The information on the Effort tab includes the estimated time and resources required to complete a particular task, which can help with budgeting, scheduling, and resource allocation.

Sync Estimate to Quote
After generating the quote from the Estimate, you may need to review and adjust the pricing information as necessary before finalizing and sending the quote to the customer.
The Sync to Quote feature allows you to sync the changes you make on the estimate directly to the quote. When you make changes to information on the estimate, you can ensure your changes are updated on the quote by clicking on the
Sync to Quote
button.
For example, suppose you change the effort or resource allocation on the estimate and click the “Sync to Quote” button. In that case, the changes are automatically reflected in the quote.
When you are viewing a quote, you can make changes on the Effort or the Scope tab. If you make changes to items on the Effort or Scope tabs, you can synchronize these changes with the Estimate by clicking on the "Sync Estimate to Quote" button.
This synchronization process updates the corresponding tabs on the Estimate with the changes you made on the Effort or Scope tabs on the Quote.
Scope
Scope Management Organized Under a Single Header
Organizing information like Services, Estimation Inputs, and Scope Summary in a single Scope tab on the quote or Estimate can help to improve the clarity and transparency of the quote, making it easier for you to understand and make an informed decision.
Manage Services sub-tab
:
The
Manage Services
sub-tab on the Scope tab displays a list of services in a multi-service Estimate or Quote.
On the Manage Services sub-tab, you can view the following fields:
Sequence
: Displays sequence number for each service row. This is a Read-Only field.
Service
: Displays the list of services linked to the activity groups from the estimate template. This is a Read-Only field.
Include in Quote
: Checkbox field with a default value as checked.
If unchecked, the service and child activity groups are marked as not applicable and removed from the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
If selected back, the service and child activity groups are marked as applicable and added to the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
Frequency
: Displays a value “One time.” This field is disabled for editing.
Estimation Inputs sub-tab
:
The
Estimation Inputs
sub-tab on the Scope tab displays the Estimation Parameters along with the original estimation guidance questions used when creating the parameters.
The Estimation Inputs sub-tab is a crucial part of the estimation process because it allows you to input specific values used in the formula builder to calculate the estimate.
If the estimation parameter requires a numeric value, you can enter that value directly into the value field on the screen.
If the parameter uses a picklist value, you can select the appropriate value from a dropdown menu.
If the parameter uses tier values, you can enter the input value relevant to your task, and the system will define the level of effort.
If you have used a checkbox and assigned a numerical value to the level of effort when a checkbox is applied, then the checkbox value will be applied to the level of effort calculation.
Scope Summary sub-tab
:
The scope summary subtab continues to serve as the location to manage and edit your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) on the estimate. You can edit activity groups, activities, and tasks, you can identify items you wish to include or exclude in the quote when converting an estimate to a quote, and you are able to update the Guidance and Assumptions fields used when originally assessing the scope of the engagement.
“Include in Quote” Selection Option on Activity Groups/Activities/Tasks
When you uncheck,
Include in Quote
at any parent level, all child items in that tree node will be unchecked and not included in the Quote. After removing these items from the quote, if you determine they need to be included in the quote, you can add them back in by returning to the estimate and checking the box next to
Include in Quote
. Once they have been synced to the quote, the checked items will appear in the quote. If you uncheck the Activity, then the tasks under that activity are also unchecked, as shown below:
To add unchecked items back into the quote, you simply add the checkbox back in for each line item that needs to be included in the quote.
Associate Estimation Parameters to Services and Activity Groups on the Estimate Template
Defining the scope of estimation parameters can be helpful for accurately estimating costs. This feature allows you to limit the estimation input parameters for task duration formula definition and to capture it on the estimate.
You can define the scope of the estimation parameters at the following levels:
Global
: Global estimation parameters are those that apply to all Services and Activity Groups.
Service Specific
: Service-specific estimation parameters are those that apply to a particular service. For example, if you are estimating the cost of providing services, you might have service-specific parameters related to the cost of project scope discovery, kickoff, implementation, testing, etc.
Activity Group specific
: Activity group specific estimation parameters are those that apply to a group of related activities. These are referred to as Standard Parameters at the activity group level.
When you click the
Add/edit estimation parameters
button on the estimate template, the
Define estimation parameters
window opens.
On the Define estimation parameters window, you will see the two new columns -
Service
and
Activity Group
.
The Service field is a search field that displays the “Global” value by default. If you click in the Service field, you will see a dropdown list of unique services linked to the estimate.
The Service column is visible or hidden based on the product feature flag Multi-services for a quote. If you change the service associated with activity groups, the Service field on the estimation parameter is defaulted to “Global.”
When the service column is hidden, then you will see all the Activity Groups from the estimate template. You can filter the Service and Activity Group dropdown list by entering specific words in the respective field.
Search Estimation Input Parameters on the Estimation Inputs tab
Having the ability to search and filter estimation input parameters can greatly enhance your workflow. With this functionality, an estimation manager can easily locate specific parameters that need to be updated or reviewed without having to manually sift through a large amount of data. This can save time and improve accuracy by ensuring that all relevant parameters are considered.
Additionally, the search and filter functionality can enable you to quickly identify any discrepancies or errors in the input parameters, allowing for swift correction before submitting the estimate or quote. This can help avoid costly mistakes and ensure the estimate or quote is as accurate as possible.
When you are on the Estimation Inputs tab of an estimate or quote, you will see a new
Search
field and two new read-only columns,
Service
and
Activity Group
. The
Service
and
Activity Group
columns show the value as defined in the estimate template. The service column is visible/hidden based on a product feature flag Multi-services for a quote.
The search field allows you to enter multiple words separated by spaces. When you perform the search, the search algorithm will look for matching text within any of the four specified columns: Service, Activity Group, Parameter Name, or Estimation Question/Guidance. The searched keywords are highlighted as bold in the filtered rows.
In addition, the search field supports "token-based search." This means it can recognize individual words or phrases within the search query and match them to specific data points in the database.

Effort
Effort Management on the Quote and Estimate
Viewing effort information directly on the Quote or Estimate can provide a clearer understanding of the work involved and help with planning and decision-making. Having access to estimated time and resources required can help identify areas of concern and allocate resources accordingly.
You can now view the effort information directly on the Quote and/or on the Estimate without navigating to other screens.
By readily making this information available, you can communicate more effectively with your team or clients, ensuring everyone is on the same page and that expectations are managed appropriately. This can lead to better outcomes and improved efficiency and productivity.
Ability to Edit Inline Effort adjustment on the Effort Tab of the Quote and the Estimate
Inline edit to the Effort on the Quote and the Estimate feature is a useful tool that allows you to quickly adjust the amount of time required to complete a task and see the impact of those adjustments on the overall cost. This feature can help you make more accurate and informed decisions about allocating resources and managing budgets.
For example, suppose you realize that a particular task will require more effort than originally estimated. In that case, you can quickly adjust the effort level in the quote or estimate and see how it affects the overall cost. Similarly, if you find a task requiring less effort than anticipated, you can adjust the effort level accordingly and see the resulting cost savings.
You can now edit the Effort Adjustment at the task level and mention the Adjustment Reason directly on the Effort tab of the Estimate and the Quote.
Inline Effort Adjustment on the Estimate
:
Inline Effort Adjustment on the Quote:
You can split the resources and specify their availability for an Activity Group on the Estimate Template. This means breaking down the required resources and determining how long each resource will be needed. This can help ensure that all the necessary resources are available when needed.
Split Resources and Specify Availability on the Estimate:
On an Estimate with a single service, click the
Resource Summary
button next to the Activity Group to split the resources and specify availability.
On an Estimate with multiple services, click the
Resource Summary
button next to the Service name to split the resources and specify availability.
The resource summary for the specific Activity Group/Service opens.
Click the dropdown list corresponding to the Resource name to select the option as shown below:
Split Resources and Specify Availability on the Quote:
On the Quote with a single service, click the
Resource Summary
button next to the Activity Group to split the resources and specify availability.
On the Quote with multiple services, click the
Resource Summary
button next to the Service name to split the resources and specify availability.
The resource summary for the specific Activity Group/Service opens.
Click the dropdown list corresponding to the Resource name to select the option as shown below:
Price Negotiation
Ability to Round Off the Quoted Amount for a Quote
As a quote manager, you can now adjust or round off the quoted amount to a round number or an amount requested by your customer. When you want to provide your customers with a pricing amount that can be clearly communicated or an amount they have requested, quote rounding enables you to round the quote to the desired amount.
This feature is particularly helpful when you combine Provus pricing capabilities to leverage resource skill sets, geographies, or other attributes that allow you to maximize margins while addressing customer price sensitivity.
To modify the pricing information on the quote:
On the Quote, click the
Adjust Pricing
button.
The
View and apply price adjustments
page opens.
On the
View and apply price adjustments
page, you will see the following fields:
Calculated Quote Amount
- The calculated quote amount is the total price determined by adding up all individual costs or line items included in the quote. This amount represents the total cost the customer would pay if they accepted the quote.
Rounding Adjustment
- A rounding adjustment is an amount added or subtracted from the calculated quote amount to ensure the final price is a round number. This adjustment is typically used when the calculated quote amount includes decimal places, and you want to simplify the price to make it more appealing to the customer.
Total Quoted Amount
: The total quoted amount is the amount that may be subject to rounding adjustments. When rounding adjustments are necessary, the total quoted amount serves as the amount to which the adjustment should be applied.
On the
View and apply price adjustments
page, click the Edit (pencil) icon nex
t
to the
Total Quoted Amount
field. This field is where you are able to edit and input the negotiated price.
The
Total Quoted Amount
field becomes editable. Enter the adjusted amount and click the
Apply
button.
After you can modify the
Total Quoted Amount
on the Quote, the
Rounding Adjustment
is automatically re-calculated as shown below:
Resources
Allocate static effort value to multiple resources for a task on Estimate Template
As an estimation manager, you can allocate a static effort for a task on an estimate template with multiple resources assigned to the task on the estimate template. This enables you to distribute the appropriate numerical effort duration to each resource on the task.
As an example, you can assign the task
Review Documents
a static duration of 90 hours by navigating to
Estimate Template
>
Add/edit task parameters
>
Estimate duration
>
Define task duration formula
page as viewed below:
When you return to the estimate template and click the
Add/edit resources
button on the estimate template,
a screen will open that will allow you to edit the resource effort for each resource. On the top of the screen, you will see the
Total Task Effort
is
90 hours
.
When you add a Requirements Analyst and Data Analyst and assign each resource an effort value of 45 hours, you will note that the total effort value of the two resources is
90 hours
, equal to the total effort defined on the top of the screen.
If you assign each resource an effort value of 49 and 40 hours, respectively, and attempt to save the values, you will see an error message in red text that states, “Total must be 90.”
You can add additional resource rows and split the total effort across additional resources.
If you add an additional resource row and leave the field empty, you will see the resource role field and the effort field highlighted in red, and you will see a message that states, “Complete this field.”
Support Decimal Points for Multi-Resource Effort on Estimate Template
When allocating resources to a project or task, it's important to assign precise effort allocations to each resource. Decimal points can be used to specify allocation percentages that are more precise than whole numbers, which allows for greater accuracy in resource planning and scheduling.
This level of precision helps optimize resource utilization and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget.
You now have the ability to specify resource effort allocation % in decimal points, which enables you to assign precise allocation to resources.
Multi Services Quoting
Assign one or more activity groups to a service
As an Estimate Template Manager, you can now create a service in Provus and assign one or more activity groups to the service. In addition, you are able to add multiple services and then assign activity groups, activities, and tasks to those services.
Add Multiple Services to an Estimate Template:
You are now able to have an estimate template with multiple services, each with its respective activity groups. This will allow you to more accurately estimate the cost and time required for each service and ensure that you provide a comprehensive estimate to your clients.
You can add multiple services to an Estimate Template by navigating to the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template.
Assign one or more Activity Groups to a Service:
As an Estimate Template Manager, you can now create a service in Provus and assign one or more activity groups to the service.
To assign one or more Activity Groups to a service:
Click the
Create/edit activity groups
button on the estimate template.
You will see a new
Service
field on the Activity Groups page.
You will see a default service value for the first activity group entry of a new estimate template. This default value is also applied to any subsequently added activity group rows.
If required, you can search and change the Service value. The Service field is a required field that must be completed in order to proceed.
The services available for selection are filtered based on the services added to the estimate template.
If you clone the Estimate template, the Service value is also cloned.
If you select
Save
and the Service field is empty, you will see a validation message to complete the field.
The estimate template header
Service
fiel
d
value displays the estimate template’s Service name if it is the only service selected.
If multiple services are selected, you can see the count of service templates attached to the estimate template. If an Activity Group is deleted, the Service field value is auto-updated.
Select/Unselect one time Services on Estimate or Quote
To manage services in an estimate, you may need to select or unselect certain services based on factors such as budget constraints and client needs. This can involve evaluating the relative importance and priority of different services and making decisions about which services are essential and which can be eliminated.
One time services are typically performed only once, rather than on a regular or recurring basis.
As an estimation manager, you can now manage services, i.e., select/unselect services with one time frequency in an estimate. This feature allows you to create an estimate as per your needs.
On the
Manage Services
sub-tab on the Scope tab of the Estimate or the Quote, you are able to view the following fields:
Sequence
: Displays sequence number for each service row. This is a Read-Only field.
Service
: Displays the list of services linked to the activity groups from the estimate template. This is a Read-Only field.
Include in Quote
: Checkbox field with a default value as checked.
If unchecked, the service and child activity groups are marked as not applicable and removed from the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
If selected, the service and child activity groups are marked as applicable and added to the estimate or quote along with the associated estimation parameters.
Frequency
: Displays a value “One time.” This field is disabled for editing.
Managed Services Tab on the Estimate:
Managed Services
Tab on the Quote:
You can select/de-select specific services and click the
Save
button to save the changes.
Support a new and existing single service for the Estimate Template, Estimate, and Quote
You can create a multi-service framework that supports both single service estimates and multi-service quotes while maintaining consistency and efficiency in your sales process.
When you create an estimate template and add a new service to the template, a new Service Template is created.
You will be able to see the service details on the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template.
When you create an Activity Group, the service value for the first activity group entry is automatically set to the service value from the estimate template header. This default value is also applied to any subsequently added activity group rows.
When you convert an estimate template to an estimate, services are copied over to the estimate, irrespective of the Enable Service Quoting feature flag.
When you create a Quote from an Estimate with a single service attached, the Quote Grid summary is aggregated by the Activity Groups.
View Service Node in Effort Tab in a Multi-Service Estimate/Quote
Having the Effort information aggregated at the service level readily available on the Estimate or Quote screens makes it easier for you to understand the cost and effort required for each service and make more informed decisions about which services to select.
As a Provus user, you can now view the Effort information aggregated at the service level, either from the Estimate or Quote, without navigating to other screens.
On the Effort tab of estimate or quote, You will see the first column as
Service/Activity Group/Activity/Task
and a read-only Service node with the service name.
The Service node is the parent node for all the activity groups that are linked to the service in the estimate template. You can expand/collapse the service node using the > icon.
Each service row shows the values aggregated from activity groups under the given service, such as the Calculated Effort, the Effort Adjustment, the Adjustment Reason, and the Total Effort.

User Persona-Based Access Control
As a Provus administrator, you can create various user personas considering the functions of the users and the permissions they need. After creating the user personas, you can assign specific permissions to them through the permission set in the setup.
A
Permission Set
is a collection of settings and permission that gives users access to various functions.
You can also bundle permission sets together based on a job function in
Permission Set Groups
. A permission set group includes all permissions in the permission sets. You can even include a permission set in more than one permission set group.
Existing Provus Personas include Sales User and Sales Manager.
Sales User Persona view
Access control and permission management are essential in securing sensitive information. As a sales user, it is important to adhere to the access control policies and only access the information you are authorized to view. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and protects the data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
As a sales user, you can access specific fields, tabs, and actions within the Provus Quoting platform. However, if you do not have sufficient permissions to view certain sensitive information, you cannot access those fields, tabs, and actions.
If the Provus administrator has assigned the “Sales User”
Permission Set Group
to a user, as shown below, then that user will not see the cost and margin on the quote.
Quote Header - Sales User View:
Quote Line Item - Sales User View:
Sales Manager Persona View
As a Sales Manager, you can access critical information like the cost and margin, enabling you to make informed decisions about pricing and resource allocation.
The sales manager can view
Margin
in the quote header as shown below:
The sales manager can view
Base Cost
,
Total Cost
, and
Margin
for each line item and in aggregate on quote line items as shown below:
The sales manager can see
Total Cost
,
Margin
, and
Margin %
on the line item price breakdown, as shown below:
Profile Based Changes
In addition to the Permission Set Group and the Permission Set settings, you may need to make specific changes to the profile based settings.
It is important to properly manage user access to custom fields in order to ensure data security and compliance with organizational policies.
Steps to remove access to custom fields for all users in a profile:
In the upper right corner of the Salesforce home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
In the left navigation pane, select
Users
>
Profiles
. The
Profiles
page opens and displays a list of all profiles.
Select the profile for which you want to remove access to custom fields. (e.g.,
Standard User
profile) You can see the profile details for the selected profile.
On the Profiles page, go to
Field-Level Security
>
Custom Field-Level Security
.
Click the
View
hyperlink corresponding to the setting you want to change. For example, click the
View
hyperlink corresponding to the
Quote
setting as shown below:
Uncheck the boxes next to the custom fields for which you want to remove access.
It is important to note that changes made to the profile's custom field-level security will affect all users assigned to that profile. If you need to remove access to custom fields for specific users, you can do so by creating a new permission set with the desired custom field-level security settings and assigning it to those users.
Ability to Hide/Show the Quote Cost/Margin
In a business setting, margin and cost information may include pricing strategies, profit margins, and cost structures of a company. This information is confidential and sensitive, and access to such information is restricted to authorized personnel who need to know.
As a Provus user, you can only view margin and cost information with sufficient permissions.
The following fields will not be visible:
Margin %
Total Cost (USD)

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the March 2023 release:
Scope - Estimate Level
View and Edit Guidance and Assumptions for improved scoping on the estimate
While creating an estimate from an estimate template, you can view the Guidance and Assumptions for Activity Group/Activity/Task originally entered on the estimated template and override the entries or add to them in the estimate so that Guidance/Assumptions can be specified as per your customers’ needs.
You can see a
Scope
tab on the Estimate. The Scope tab displays the Activity Group/Activity/Task along with the
Guidance and Assumptions
columns. These columns display the text inherited from the Guidance and Assumption columns for each row of the estimate template for the corresponding activity group, activity, and task.
You can edit the Guidance and Assumptions text value directly in the estimate, where the columns display the last saved values from the estimate.
If the Guidance or Assumptions text exceeds the viewable area, you can hover the mouse over the text box to see a pop-up that displays the full text.
Rename Activity Group/Activity/Tasks on an Estimate
You can now rename the Activity Group/Activity/Tasks on the estimate. This feature allows you to specify the corresponding labels as required for your project.
Guidance and assumptions entries can be edited on the estimate by clicking the pencil icon next to Guidance or Assumptions on the Activity Group, Activity, or Task. Users can update the text with corresponding guidance questions or assumptions that will assist with scoping activities.
When you click the
Edit
icon corresponding to the ActivityGroup/Activity/Task names, the text box becomes editable, and you can edit an existing label.
Support formula calculation for Tiers/Picklist/Checkbox data type in the Estimate
As an Estimate Manager, you can see the task duration calculated correctly when the formula for a task utilizes parameters with the data type picklist, tiers, or checkboxes. This enhancement enables you to obtain an accurate task duration value on the estimate, based upon the value associated with the data type.
As an example, consider the following effort estimation scenarios for a software development project.
Estimate parameter value for the parameter with the “Checkbox” data type
If you want an offshore team to work on your project, you can create an
OffShore team needed
parameter with the checkbox data type on the Estimate Template
as shown
below:
You can define the checked value duration on the Estimate Template.
On the
Estimation Inputs
tab of the Estimate, the parameter value is set depending on your selection:
If you do not need an offshore team to work on your project, leave the checkbox as
Unchecked
and the parameter value will be set as 0.
If you need an offshore team to work on your project,
Select
the checkbox and the checked value as defined in the Estimate Template is set for the parameter.
If no checked value is defined in the Estimate Template for the parameter, then the parameter value is set to 0.
Estimate parameter value for the parameter with “Picklist” as the data type
Your project development modules may have various levels of complexity. In such a case, you can create a
Module Development
parameter with the picklist data type on the Estimate Template as displayed below:
You can set multiplier values for the picklist parameter and assign effort values to them.
On the
Estimation Inputs
tab of the Estimate, the parameter value is set depending on your selection:
If a “Multiplier Value” is set in the Estimate Template for the picklist selected by the user, then the same value is set as a parameter value in the estimate.
For example, if you select
High
from the picklist, as shown below, the
Effort Value
is 480, as defined in the multiplier value on the picklist.
If no “Multiplier Value” is set for the picklist value in the Estimate Template, then the parameter value is 0.
Estimate parameter value for the parameter with “Tiers” data type
If you have various levels or layers of system architecture in your project, you can define a
Module Design
parameter with the Tiers data type selected on the Estimate Template as shown below:
You can set the different tier values for the tiers and assign corresponding effort values to them:
On the Estimation Inputs tab of the Estimate, the parameter value is set depending on your selection:
If a “Tier Value” is set in the Estimate Template for the value entered by the user, then the same value is set as a parameter value in the estimate.
For example, you enter 25 module designs on the estimate. When the tier value in the Estimate Template for the range 23 to 30 is set as 300, then the parameter value on the estimate is 300 because 25 falls within the tier range from 23 to 30.
If no “Tier Value” is set for the tier on Estimate Template, then the parameter value is set as 0.
For example, you enter value 35 on the estimate. There is no tier value for that number set in the Estimate Template. So, the parameter value is 0.
If you do not enter any value on the Estimate, then the parameter value is 0.
Improved performance of Estimated Duration calculations
As a Quote Manager, when you set values for the estimation parameters, the Estimated Duration values in the Estimate tree are updated immediately. This allows you to quickly see the impact of any changes you make to the scope on the overall duration of the project.
On the Estimation Inputs tab, you can set values for the estimation parameters and save with no expected impact to performance.
The Estimated Duration values in the Estimate tree are updated immediately.
Resource Allocation
Create an estimate with multiple resources per task
As an estimate manager, when you have a need to assign multiple resources to a task, you can create an estimate from an estimate template with more than one resource assigned to each task.
To add multiple resources to a task:
On the Estimate Template, click the
Add/Edit resources
button.
The Add/edit resources window opens, which displays the list of added resources and the effort % assigned to each.
Click the
Add row
button to add a new resource.
Select the
Resource Role
name, add
effort %
, and click the
Save
button.
When you create an estimate from an estimate template with multiple resources, you can see the task role summary for each unique task role with the following data:
Resource name
Effort %
To view the task role summary:
On the
Resources
tab, click the resources link corresponding to the task.
You will see the task role summary for each unique task role.
By creating a summary of resource roles with the effort allocation for each task, you will quickly see which resources are assigned to each task and how much effort they are responsible for.
New field
Effort
is calculated as
Effort%
*
Estimated Duration
for the task.
In the example below, the Effort% for each resource is set as 65% for the Business Analyst, 25% for the Product Manager, and 10% for the Solution Architect.
The total
Estimated Duration
for the
Scope Discovery
Activity Group is 132 hours. You can see the resource breakdown by clicking the
Resource Summary
button.
Since 65% of the total effort was allocated to the
Business Analyst
, their effort is calculated as 65% of 132, i.e., 85.8 hours.
Added Resources tab to the Estimate
You can see a
Resources
tab on the Estimate. When you click the resources tab, you can see a list of all tasks on the estimate and the number of resources assigned to each task.
When you click on the number of resources assigned to the task, it expands to a view of resources by role and the effort % allocation for each resource.
View and edit multiple resources assigned to a task on the estimate
As an estimation manager, you can now view and edit multiple resources as well as the allocated effort assigned to the task on the resources tab of an estimate. This functionality allows you to have an estimate and quote with multiple resources per task.
When you click the
Resources
tab, you can see a list of all tasks on the estimate and the number of resources (as a hyperlink) assigned to each task. If a single resource is assigned to a task, you will see the resource role name as a hyperlink.
When you click on the resources hyperlink, it expands to a view of resources by role and the effort % allocation for each resource. You can delete a Resource Role, add a new Resource Role, and edit the Effort%.
The
Total
equals the sum of the Effort %. The value is recalculated if you change or delete a value in the Effort %.
Validations
If the Resource Role or Effort (%) is empty, you will get the following validation message:
If the Effort % column Total does not equal 100, you will get the following validation message:
If the Effort % value is less than or equal to 0, you will get the following validation message:
When you click the
Save
button, and there are no validation errors, the resources are assigned successfully.
Create a quote from an estimate with multiple resources per task
As a quote administrator, you can create a quote from an estimate where multiple resources are assigned to tasks.
You can create a new quote by clicking on the
New Quote
button on the Estimate.
For each resource, resource availability is considered while creating a schedule on the quote grid.
The new quote created from the estimate displays multiple resources assigned per task:
Multi Services Quoting - A Beta Preview Feature
Create an Estimate Template with Multiple Services
You can create an Estimate Template with multiple services.
Note:
To create multiple services, the system administrator has to enable Service Quoting in the Provus setup details. In addition to enabling the service quoting flag, you need to make page layout changes to estimate template and estimate objects to start using it.
After Service Quoting is enabled, you can create and assign a service to an Activity Group on the Estimate Template.
To add services to the Estimate Template, a related Service Template is required. On the Service Template, you have to enter the Estimate Template name, add a service, mark it as Active and assign a sequence number to it.
There are two ways to create a Service Template:
By clicking the
New
button in the Service section of the
Related
tab on the Estimate Template.
While mapping the service to an Activity Group, there is an option to create a new service template.
On the
Related
tab of the Estimate Template, you can click on the Activity Group link for which you want to add a Service.
On the Activity Group Template page, you can enter the Service Template name or create a New Service Template and save it.
You can see the added services under the
Service
section of the Related tab on the Estimate Template. The number in the bracket indicates the number of services added to the Estimate Template.
Create an Estimate with Multiple Services
You can create an Estimate from an Estimate Template with multiple services by clicking the
New Estimate
button.
On the
Related
tab of the Estimate, you will see the
Estimate Services
mapped from the Estimation Template.
Since the Estimate Template had 3 services created and assigned to the Activity Groups, you can see 3 services on the Estimate.
Create a Quote with Multiple Services
You can now create a quote from the Estimate with multiple services by clicking the
New Quote
button on the Estimate.
A new quote is generated, and the resources are aggregated by the different services on the quote grid.
View resources aggregated by services on the quote grid
You can now create quotes from the estimate, which have multiple services assigned to activity groups. As a sales manager, you can view resources aggregated by service on the quote grid.
When you create a quote from an estimate with multiple services, you will see the following details on the quote grid:
The first column header is labeled Service.
Services from the estimate is a separate section.
Resources are under the corresponding Service section.
Pricing - Add-Ons
Enhancements and Simplifications for Add-Ons Quoting
Enhancements to Add-Ons simplify and improve the process for adding expenditure items to a quote. Users can access and add an add-on to a quote when the add-on item exists as an ancillary product on the rate card.
You can add a product such as travel, equipment, or conference room and define the frequency and price methodology used to calculate the add-on amounts.
Frequency can be determined by weeks, months, quarters, or years based on user preference.
Price method can include % of revenue, flat price, or per head. When you select the % of revenue, you will be able to enter the % of revenue to be applied to the add-on line item.
Calculations for add-on amounts will be made based on price, frequency, and if applicable, percentage multiplication.
Examples:
If the add-on is travel, and monthly quote revenue is $10,000, and the pricing method is a percentage of revenue at 10%, then the monthly add-on amount would be $1,000 (10% of $10,000).
If the add-on is equipment and the pricing is $300 per head per quarter, and there are 5 resources on the quote, then the quarterly equipment amount would be $1,500 (5 x $300).
If the add-on expense is for a conference room and the pricing method is a flat price of $2000, and the frequency is monthly, then you will see the add-on amount of $10,000 for 5 months of the quote.
To simplify add-ons quoting, we have the following adjustments on the
Add-Ons
tab:
Removed % of Cost from the
Price Method
field.
Removed Phase End from the
Frequency
field.
Example of Add-ons fields populated.
You can apply discounts to each add-on by entering the discount percentage in the
Disc %
field of the row of the add-on item.
Approval Enhancements
Quote Approval enhancement locks quote during approval process
When you submit a quote for approval, the quote becomes locked and is no longer editable until it is either approved or rejected by the approver.
When you navigate to a quote that has been submitted for approval, you will see a notification on the top of the screen notifying you the record is locked and that you cannot make further edits while it is in locked status.
You will get a notification that the quote is in locked status.
Based on the approval process setup, any time the approval process or workflow process marks the quote as "Locked / Read-only", this notification will appear.
For example, an approval process can mark a quote as "Pending Approval" or "Approved". The approval process can also lock the quote based on other criteria.
To enable quote locking on quotes that are submitted for approval, you can use the Salesforce Process Automation settings to enable record locking.
Bug Fix for non-numeric input in the discount field
Entering Non-numeric data in the discount field no longer throws an error message
When you enter non-numeric data in the discount field, you will no longer see an error message related to the entry. Previously if you entered a +10% Discount or a -10% discount in the field, you would see an error message. Now, if you enter non-numeric data in the discount field, the entry is erased from the field.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following enhancements in the February 2023 release:
Estimation Enhancements
Estimation Parameters on Estimate Template
We have made usability enhancements to the Estimate Template to improve the overall end-user experience in setting up parameters for calculating estimate durations. The estimation parameters are now set up from a single place
Add/Edit estimation parameter.
The following enhancements are introduced for the estimate template:
Renaming
: The
Add/Edit scope parameters
button on the estimate template header is renamed to
Add/Edit estimation parameters
.
Reorganization
: The
Add/Edit estimation parameter
action is moved to be located next to the
Create/Edit activity groups
action, which should make it easier for end-users to locate and use
.
Removal
: The
Add/Edit scope parameters
are removed from the Activity Group and Activity level, which should help simplify the template and reduce confusion for end-users.
Image: Add/edit scope parameters are replaced with Add/edit estimation parameters and are moved next to Create/edit activity groups
Estimation Parameter Data Type, Drop Down Menu Changes
We have made changes to the estimation parameter to add clarity to menu selection options and help users identify the parameter data type.
We have introduced the following changes to the data type:
Renamed the Integer data type to
Number
for better clarity.
Changed the Integer tiers to
Tiers
.
Added the
Add Values
icon next to the Tiers, Picklist, and Checkbox data types, making adding values easier.
Added a new validation message instructing users to “Complete this field”. If these columns are not filled, the validation error message will be displayed with red text.
These changes should help users understand the data types and input requirements and make adding values for certain parameters easier.
Image: Estimation parameters picklist options include - Picklist, Tiers, Checkbox, and Number
Image: Complete this field notification for added estimation parameters that are not populated
Assign Effort Value to the Tiers, Picklist, and Checkbox Data Type Parameters
After clicking the
Add Values
icon, users can now specify both the values and assigned effort value for the following parameter types:
For tier-type parameters, the tier values and assigned effort value for each tier can be defined.
For each sequence in a tier, the from and to values can be defined with a corresponding numeric effort value.
For picklist-type parameters, the picklist values and assigned effort value for each picklist value can be defined.
For each picklist sequence, a name and corresponding effort value can be assigned.
For checkbox-type parameters, the effort value is defined when the checkbox is checked. The system considers the effort value as 0 for unchecked parameters.
When a specific numeric effort value is entered, that value will be displayed as the effort when the checkbox is checked.

Task Duration Calculation Formula Using New Formula Builder
Using User-Defined Parameters, Standard Parameters or Static Values in the Formula
Provus provides estimation managers the capability to leverage formula or value inputs to calculate estimated durations for specific tasks.
On each task of an estimate template, estimation managers can click the
Estimate Duration
button on the Add/Edit task parameter dialog to enter the formula or static value that will facilitate the calculation of the task duration.
Estimation managers can use one or a combination of the following parameters to build the formula:
On the Define task duration formula screen, User-defined estimation parameters are available under “User-defined” parameter drop-down menu.
User-defined parameters are created using Add/edit estimation parameters.
Standard parameters are system-defined parameters that hold the total activity group or activity duration. These are available under the “Activity Group” and “Activity” parameter drop-down menus.
The name of the activity group or activity will be a drop-down selection under
Activity Group
or
Activity
on the Define task duration formula screen. When selected, enter directly into the Task duration formula.
Static duration values.
This is a numeric value that is entered directly into the field and is not part of a formula.
When a user selects any parameter from the drop-down menu, that parameter is added to the task duration formula. This provides flexibility for building a formula with different parameters, operators, and input values.
As shown in the example below, an estimation parameter called “interviews” was created as a user-defined parameter. The estimation manager can then define the formula by selecting “interviews” as the user-defined parameter and multiplying it by any number (for example, 4) to calculate the effort duration in hours for each interview.
Note
: The formula in the estimate template will be calculated on the estimate when a numeric value is applied to the user-defined parameter.
Image: Define task duration formula user using user-defined parameter
Standard parameters can be defined using a corresponding activity group or activity to calculate the duration of a separate task not affiliated with the identified activity group or activity.
As an example, if the user has an activity group entitled “implementation” and there is a task entitled “PM Oversight”, the user can select the activity group standard parameter, “implementation” and add it to the formula builder. When “PM Oversight” is 50% of total “implementation” time then the user can multiply by 50% to calculate the task duration effort.
Image: Example of using standard parameter in the formula
When an estimation manager wants to specify a task duration using a static numeric value, they can type the numeric value directly into the Task Duration Formula field as a value.
For example, if the task is expected to take 40 hours, the user can simply enter "40" as a static value in the field.
Image: Example of the static value entered directly into the Estimation duration field
Estimation Inputs on the Estimate
We have added a new
Estimation Inputs
tab on the Estimate, which provides estimation managers with a tabular view for entering input estimation parameter values.
This new tab replaces the earlier Scope Discovery feature. Within the Estimation Inputs tab, users can view and set the estimation parameter values for the estimate.
In addition, the Estimation Inputs tab allows estimation managers to update the estimation parameter values, recalculate the task duration values, and update them on the estimate.
This feature provides greater flexibility and control for estimation managers, allowing them to easily adjust input values and view the impact on estimated task durations.

Resource Rate Markups on Quote
Negative Discounts to Increase Resource Rates in Quotes
Key resources are highly valuable to both Provus customers and the organizations they serve. At times, companies request key resources to be deployed on specific projects. These resource-specific requests can affect resource availability, scheduling, and even customer satisfaction.
When one or more key resources are in high demand and quote managers aim to satisfy important customers, negative discounting can apply a premium price to these key resources.
For instance, let's consider company ABC, which employs Project Manager A (PM A). Three of ABC company’s customers have requested PM A to work on their specific project. The standard rate for a project manager is $100 per hour. Due to the increased demand for PM A, the quote manager may use a negative discount of -50% on the line item to increase the price of PM A to $150 per hour for the project. By adding a negative discount to PM A, ABC company can yield a $50 per hour revenue increase.
Image: Line-Item discounting shows the application of -a 50% discount for the Data Analyst role.
Visibility to Base Cost on Quote Line Items
Base Cost for Each Quote Resource
The Provus quote grid now includes the resource unit cost as the base cost for each resource added to a line item. With this change, users can view the fields,
Base Price
and
Base Cost
for each resource added to a quote line item.
As a result of pricing transparency, users can gain a clear understanding of where all pricing activities begin with respect to revenue and margin.
Additionally, this visibility helps users understand how revenue adjustments and discounting can impact the overall performance of each resource on the quote.
Image: Base cost from the rate card unit cost is added to the quote line-item pricing for each resource
Guidance and Assumptions on Activity Group/Activity/Task (Beta)
In addition to the current
Guidance
field used for scoping, we have added a new
Assumptions
field to Activity Group/Activity/ Task tree to be included in each row of the Estimate Template.
The
Guidance
fields are provided to enable users to specify scoping questions related to activity groups, activities, and tasks. The
Assumptions
fields are designed for users to capture customer-specific answers related to the scoping questions.
Users can enter assumptions in the pop-ups launched from:
Create/Edit Activity Groups
Add/Edit Activities
Add/Edit Tasks
This functionality allows the user to specify a question and corresponding answer that will help specify assumptions being made while setting up a given estimate template.
An example of a guidance question may include:
How many users will access the system?
How many tasks will be required for this activity?
Is this task dependent on any other task?
An example of assumptions may include:
The activity requires only 2 tasks.
The task depends on

Multi-Resource Setup on Estimate Template
Selection of Multiple Resources Per Task
We have added a feature that allows users to assign multiple resources to a task at the Estimate Template level. This feature is in beta and available as of the Feb 2023 release.
For organizations with the feature enabled, users can assign multiple resources to a task in the Estimate Template.
For organizations where the feature is not enabled, users can only assign one resource to a task on the Estimate Template using Add/Edit tasks.
Percentage of Effort Allocation
Users can enter the effort percentage for each of the selected resource roles such that the total effort percentage is 100%. An error is shown if the total effort percentage is not 100%.
For example, an admin, consultant, and principal all need to be assigned to a task.
The below table shows a possible resource allocation:
Task
Resource Rate
Effort Percentage
Inspection
Admin
20
Consultant
30
Principal
50
Multiple Resources Supported in Estimate Template
As part of the Feb 2023 release, multiple resource allocation to a task is only supported on the estimate template, and it does not carry through to the estimate and quote.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following enhancements in the January 2023 release.
Multi-Currency Support
The new Provus functionality is designed to support organizations who need the capability to provide quotes in multiple currencies and/or geographies.
Quote Pricing - Rate Card Currency
When a quote manager needs to deliver a quote in a specific currency, the currency specified on the rate card is used to provide the quote in the desired currency.
As an example, if you have a rate card with resources from a number of geographies, however, if you specify the rate card currency as Indian Rupees or INR, then your quote is issued in INR. Below an example of the rate card currency definition and quote pricing are provided.
Rate card specified in Indian Rupees (INR)
The quote header, the quote summary, quote line item details, and quote price breakdown will all be reported in the currency designated in the quote rate card.
Quote Header pricing in rate card currency (INR)
Quote line item pricing in rate card currency (INR)

Estimate Pricing - Rate Card Currency
Given a user is creating an estimate template and selects the corresponding currency for the rate card, the Estimate header will display the rate card currency in the estimate header. If the rate card currency is selected as Indian Rupees, the estimate header will contain INR as the currency for the Estimate

Pricing Adjustment Set up
The power of Provus quoting lies in the system’s robust pricing capabilities with the flexibility to price deals to meet revenue and margin objectives while managing and adapting to customer price sensitivities.
Provus pricing functionality enables users to account for pricing uncertainties due to inflationary pressures, add contingencies for fixed bid engagements, and apply targeted discounting; which focuses on increased utilization, pricing incentives to leverage resources from diverse geographies, and the ability to provide a flat quote level discount to quickly win deals.
Quote managers have the ability to make pricing adjustments to revenue and costs in one place by using the “Adjust pricing” tab.
Adjust Pricing tab
The “Pricing adjustments” tab opens up an adjustments dialog that allows quote managers to adjust for expected annual increases in the cost of living adjustment (COLA), to adjust for contingency on fixed bid quotes, and to apply an appropriate discount methodology.
Pricing Adjustments menu options
COLA Passthrough
Provus pricing capability enables service providers the ability to plan for and adapt to the risks associated with increasing labor costs on multi-year quotes.
When labor costs for your organization increase 8% annually, the Provus system can account for these increasing costs in the system by applying a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) rate adjustment for costs.
In addition to factoring in labor cost increases into multi-year quotes, Provus provides the ability to offset or partially offset labor cost increases by applying a COLA Passthrough rate to quote revenue which adjusts resource pricing to compensate for increasing costs.
While COLA costs are set globally by the administrator, COLA Passthrough rates are able to be managed at the quote level and adjusted according to the discretion of the quote manager. Examples of managing quote specific pricing in the Adjust Pricing tab can be seen below:
Example of COLA and COLA Passthrough pricing adjustments
Contingency
Fixed bid or fixed price quotes are commonly used strategies for organizations purchasing services. Cost overruns create a risk to overall project margins because the service provider is not able to bill for time and materials that exceed the projected duration on the quote or contract.
Provus provides a fixed bid contingency feature in its pricing engine which provides quote managers the capability to apply a contingency percentage to a quote to mitigate the risk of exceeding the estimated quote duration for specified resources.
Applying a Contingency percentage to a fixed bid quote
Quote-Level Discount
When an organization needs to make immediate, on-the-fly pricing adjustments to win a deal, Provus provides the ability to create precise and immediate discounts which are able to be applied to the entire quote. This is referred to as a quote level discount and offers the ability to apply a flat percentage rate discount to the quote.
Quote level discount percentage applied to the account
When a quote level discount is applied the quote level discount percentage is inherited on the line item. It is important to note that if a quote level discount is applied any location or volume discount will be cleared as only one type of discount is able to be applied.
Disc % is Inherited from the quote level discount
Location Discount and Line Item Discount pricing Adjustments
To promote the utilization of resources in a specific geographic area, Provus provides quote managers the ability to provide location discounts by location (country / state / city / zone).
As an example, when I apply a 10% discount for resources in the United States, or even more precisely for the United States Palo Alto then the prescribed discount will be applied to the resources in the specific geography.
Labor Discount - By Location applied based on quote resource geography
When a quote manager applies a location discount to a quote the discount percentage for the location is effectively applied to the quote resource line item, and on the line item price breakdown.
Location discounts are inherited as a discount percentage on line item pricing and are included in individual resource amounts on the line item price breakdown.
Applied discount totals also roll up into the calculation of adjustments in the quote header and quote summaries calculations.
Only one type of discount can be applied to the quote. When a location discount is applied to a quote then the quote level or volume level discounts will be cleared as only one type of discount is able to be applied. Below is a view of the location discounts inherited at the line item for each resource based on the geography of the resource.

Volume Discount
Leveraging discounting is a great way for quote managers to Increase resource utilization or total quote revenue. Provus provides volume discount capability which enables quote managers to encourage customers to increase resource quantities or total revenues on a quote.
Volume discounts can be effectively leveraged by deploying tiered resources targets for a period, period group, or the entire quote. Or discount incentives can be applied based upon labor revenue for a specified period, period group, or quote.
Only one type of discount can be applied to a quote. When a volume discount is applied to a quote then location or quote level discount will be cleared. Below is an example of the tiers that can be applied to a quote to establish volume discounts for the period, period group, or quote duration.
Volume discounts based on person periods
Volume discounts based on Labor Revenue (currency example in INR)
Line Item Discount
Line item discounts can be inherited from location discounts or quote level discounts. They are also able to be directly edited by the quote manager. The line item discount is a key lever that can be used in pricing to help quote managers adjust pricing to win deals while providing control of the magnitude and overall impact of the discount.

Rate Card Enhancements
Rate Card Item Location Definitions
Rate cards provide power to services organizations transparency to resource pricing in unique locations and geographies. This can be vitally important in the sales process when geographic pricing is critical to winning a deal.
Provus rate cards enable quote managers to enter resource pricing on the rate card based on the geography of each resource. When entering resources on a rate card the Country/Location is a required field as it is likely to play a key role in pricing and deal optimization.
Resource country is mandatory for each rate card resource

Estimation - Enhancements
Provus estimation enhancements provide users the ability to leverage rolled up calculations displayed for activity groups, activities, and tasks to be leveraged as parameters for calculating task durations for tasks in same or separate activities and activity groups. These estimation duration totals calculated at the activity group or activity level are referred to as standard parameters.
Support Standard Parameters
User defined parameters are scope parameters defined by an action or actions used to calculate the duration of a task. A standard parameter is the rolled up duration of multiple tasks into a calculated duration for an activity group or activity.
The example below provides a use case that defines the difference between a user defined parameter and a standard parameter and how the standard parameter can be utilized to define a task duration while leveraging a previously calculated duration for an activity group or activity.
Below is a use case of how user defined parameters and standard parameters can be used cooperatively within an estimate template.
Consider the following Activity Groups, Activities, and Tasks with calculated durations for each rolled up at the Activity and Activity group levels:
Estimate Template for Design, Development, & QA
You will notice that there are multiple user defined task parameters that roll up into the duration calculations for Activity groups and activities. User defined parameters are calculated using a scope parameter identified by name and by hashtag when defining scope parameters for the estimate template.
An example of the scope parameters for the solution design listed in the estimate template above can be found in the attached diagram below.
User defined global scope parameters
When an estimation manager wants to use user defined parameters to calculate a task duration they can generate a task parameter using an integer, integer tiers, picklist, or checkbox selections to assist in estimating the value of a parameter.
In the following example, you will note that the expected duration for requirements documentation is calculated by using a user defined global parameter multiplied by an expected duration for each time the parameter is repeated to create a calculated duration:
Duration for the task module design
The task parameter for the task Module design identifies the number of modules multiplied by the expected duration to create a module, to calculate the estimated duration for the task.
If you complete the scope discovery on your estimate template and identify the number of modules to be created as ten, then you will note that the expected duration of the activity is 160 hours as noted in the Estimate template above.
A standard parameter leverages predetermined calculations for one or more Activity groups and/or activities to calculate the expected duration of a task that is part of a separate activity group or task.
As an example, a project management organization may wish to hire a project manager to provide oversight over all of the Activity groups, activities, and tasks in the estimate template pictured above.
The general expected project management oversight for all estimated Design, Development and testing activities is 15%. In this instance A 4th Activity group is able to be added to the estimate template titled PM Oversight. An Activity group and task for PM oversight is also able to be added to the estimate template. In this instance an estimation manager is able to calculate the expected duration of PM oversight using each Activity Group and Activity as a Standard Parameter input to define the duration of the task parameter. The example below uses each Activity group from the estimate template above to calculate the duration for the task PM Oversight
Example of using Standard parameters in a formula to calculate duration
When expected durations are stated and/or calculated for all tasks that roll up to expected durations for activity groups, and activities on an estimate, then expected duration of the tasks calculated using standard parameters are also able to be calculated. In the example below note that Activity group 4, PM Oversight is calculated in the Estimate template using the output values from Activity Groups 1-3.
Calculated duration for Activity Group PM Oversight
It is important to note that the standard identification of a user defined parameter is with a hashtag. As an example number of users may be identified by #users where it can be referenced in a formula. Standard parameters do not require a hashtag and instead reference an activity group or an activity on the estimate template as an input value to calculate a separate output.
The standard parameter for an Activity group is defined as follows:
The $ symbol precedes the number of the Activity group, followed by an underscore symbol and the name of the activity group. If there were additional words in the activity group there would be an additional underscore preceding each additional word).
Example: $1_Design
The standard parameter for an activity is defined similarly with the exception that there is an underscore before the first number and second number of the activity. Example: $3_1_Quality_Assurance_Testing
Avoid Circular Reference When Calculating Standard Parameters
When creating a Standard parameter, be sure to avoid making an input variable depending on an output that is also used in the input as this will create a circular reference and will not yield a calculated duration from an estimate to an estimate template.
As an example:
If Task Parameter “
1.1 Module design
” is dependent on Standard Parameter “
1 Design
” as an input then “
Task Parameter 1.1
” is already a subset of the total duration of the designated standard parameter. This will generate a circular reference because an output formula cannot reference an input that is already used to generate a specific output.
Task parameters can leverage output calculations from Standard parameters (“Activity groups” and “Activities”) as long as those outputs are not dependent on one another in calculating independent durations. Codependency in duration among standard parameters will likely result in a circular reference resulting in no duration output for the task parameter in which the circular reference exists.
Resource & Period / Period Group Level negotiated prices
For each resource on the quote line item quote managers are able to view the following for period and period group:
Quoted amount
Quoted price per unit
Cost
Margin information
Calculated granular amounts for period or period groups are able to be persisted so they are available for integration with documentation in upstream or downstream systems. This facilitates the transparency necessary to see the impact of period pricing adjustments on the ability to price and win deals as well as the ability to provide in depth quoting analysis.
This level of transparency provides insight into the base price of a quote with an itemized view of how revenue adjustments or discounts can increase or decrease the quoted price at the line level to influence decision makers in the buying process. The pricing breakdown itemizes the base price of the resource, accounts for adjustments (positive revenue impacts) and discounts (negative revenue impacts) and calculates a quoted price for each resource.
The quoted price of resources may fluctuate across periods or stay flat based upon applied pricing adjustments and discounts as they are aligned to periods, period groups, or the entire quote.
Quoted Item Price Breakdown by Period
Quote Item price breakdown by period captures the following data elements for each resource role captured as a line item on the quote:
Period Group - The period group for which the quote period is applied
Period - Pricing for a specific defined period on the quote
Hours/Labor units - The total number of hours or labor units worked for the period. If labor units are hours it will display total hours for the period, if labor units is recorded in periods it will be displayed as the total number of labor units for the period
Base Amt
- The base amount of the quote for the period prior to pricing adjustments
Cola Passthrough - A revenue adjustment made based on the application of a Cola Passthrough percent being applied to quote revenue
Contingency - A contingency applied to a fixed bid quote to mitigate risk of exceeding expected quote task activities
Adjusted Amt
- Adjusted quote revenue including the sum of the Base Amt + Cola Passthrough Amt + Contingency
Line Disc Amt - The line item discount amount applied to a quote item for a specific period
Vol Disc Amt - The line item discount amount applied to a quote item for a specific period
Discounted Amt
- The total amount of discounts to be applied to a quoted amount for a specific period (includes Line Disc Amt + Vol Disc Amt)
Quote Price - The quoted price of the resource for the period with all adjustments and discounts included in the price
Quoted Amt - The price of all resources on the quote line item, adjusted for adjustments and discounts
Total Cost - The total cost of line item resources for the period
Margin - The total revenue amount exceeding costs for the period
Margin %
- (Quoted Amt - Total Cost)/Quoted Amt for the period
See view of the line item price breakdown by period below:
Line item price breakdown by period
The quoted price by period can be pushed by Provus to various downstream systems for reporting, billing, or administrative purposes.
Quoted Item Price Breakdown by Period Group
The quoted item pricing breakdown for each period group is visible to the customer via the period price breakdown.
The quote manager is able to view the period group totals for each quote line resource on the quote grid. The sum of the period totals for each resource will be equal to the period group totals on the quote grid. See example of quote grid totals for each period group on the quote line item.
Quote Item totals for period group are a sum of period totals aggregated to the period group
Quoted/Negotiated Price by Period/Period Group
Quoted price for the period or the period is able to be calculated for each period or period group to determine the quoted unit price for the resource for each period in which resources prices are provided.
The following formula is used to calculate resource pricing by period/period group:
Total amount of all resources / (number of resources per period/period group)
Quote Grid Pricing
Quote grid pricing captures resource pricing for the duration of a quote which is a rollup of period or period group pricing. Price line item breakdown pricing is a subset of line item pricing and is visible by clicking on the quoted amount total for the line item.
Quote grid pricing provide quote managers the visibility to the following pricing details for each line item resource:
Role - Resource role included in the price
Base Price
- The base price for the resource role without adjustments or discounts
Disc % - The percentage of the discount applied to a resource line item
Total Person (periods) - The specified person periods quoted for the resource
Quoted Price
- The quoted price of the resource with adjustments and discounts
Quoted Amount
- The total quoted amount for the resource over the duration of a quote (which includes total labor units X Quoted Price)
Total Cost - The total cost of the resource over the duration of the quote
Margin %
- (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Revenue
The table below shows an example of the line item price details for different resource roles within the quote grid:
Line item detail resource pricing - line item quoted amount
Summary Tab
The Provus summary tab provides quote managers insight into specific aspects of the quote used to win the deal. Summaries have been designed to provide users visibility to the overall quote negotiated prices with adjustments and discount as well as a view of pricing for periods, period groups, specific resources, and resources provided by location.
Summary Header details Negotiated Price Cost & Margin
Provus summary header provides an immediate snapshot of the overall quote with the quoted amount for labor and all adjustments (adjustments and discounts), Add-ons amount, a view of total cost, the total quoted amount, the margin amount, and the margin percentage.
Summaries tab header with quoted amount, adjustments, costs, margins, margin amount, and margin %
Period Group Summary
The period group summary allows quote managers and executives into quote performance at the period level. This shows the changes in overall revenues, costs, margins, and margin percentages over different period groups and provides high-level visibility to margins over the duration of the quote.
Period group summary
Resource Role Summary
The resource role summary includes a list view of each resource role on the quote. Resource role metrics include: total person periods for each role, the percentage of total headcount the role represents, quoted amount, % of quoted amount, the total cost, percent of total cost, and the margin percentage affiliated with the role.
Resource role summary
Location Summary
Provus provides the levers necessary to adjust quote pricing by providing the availability to leverage quote resources from diverse geographies. This enables the ability to manage revenue costs, and margins on a quote.
The location summary imparts users with the knowledge and the ability to see the percentage of resources located in a specific geography, the revenue and costs associated with those resources, as well as the overall margin impact of leveraging resources from distinct geographies.
Location summary
Quote Header
The quote header has been redesigned to provide swift visibility to overall quote revenue, cost, and margin so the user is able to quickly view quote performance metrics and check those against organizational pricing targets or objectives.
Net Quoted Amount / Margin
The quote header now provides a systemic reference number that identifies the quote. This number starts with Q- and contains five numeric digits after the dash. A description column exists and contains a brief description of the quote.
If there is a Salesforce account related to the quote it is visible in the account field. The
Total Amount
field is populated with the total amount of the quote, Total adjustments column includes adjustments to revenue through COLA Passthrough (where applicable) and any adjustments to pricing made via discounting. An Add-ons adjustment column calculates the total revenue derived from quote ad-ons. The final column captures the overall quote margin percentage.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the December 2022 release:
Mass Add Resources
Multi-Column Search - Resource Key words Must Match Resource Attributes
Provus Add Resources functionality allows users to quickly view all resources from a rate card which can be added to a quote. Many organizations have multiple locations and often have hundreds of resources and roles which can be assigned to a quote. This can make finding a specific resource difficult or time consuming to locate.
Provus enables quote managers to use multiple keywords in a search with each word separated by a single space. As an example when a user wants to search for a Requirements Analyst in India with a Level 2 skillset, they can simply type: Requirements India L2 in the search bar and the results will return all Requirements Analysts with a Level 2 skillset in India.
In the event I am searching for an Architect, I can simply type Arc and any resources with Arc in one of the fields will be displayed.
Resource Mass Add Capability replaces CSV Upload and Single Line Resource Editing
Now users are able to Add multiple resources to a quote by selecting “Add Resources” and the user will be able to view all resources that are able to be added to the quote by simply checking the box next to the resource to be added to the quote. This new functionality is a substantial enhancement to improve and reduce quote cycle times.
The CSV upload template to upload resources into the quote grid and align them to existing pricing in the rate card is no longer needed and has been removed from the “Add Resources” process. Users will no longer see an option to “Upload Resources” when clicking on a resource role within the quote grid.
To add additional efficiency, Provus has removed and replaced the prior “Add Resource” functionality which required users to add individual resources to a line item by clicking add resources and then specifying a single resource to the quote. New functionality expedites the process of adding resources by allowing the user to multi-select required resources from the rate card and immediately adding those resources to the quote grid.
Milestone Enhancements
Add Milestone Amount to Quote Milestones
Provus users have the ability to see a Milestone Amount field that enables them to enter and view Milestone amounts for a specific scope of work. When the user clicks on the Milestone tab and has identified a specific Milestone type to apply to the quote, the Milestone is displayed under the Milestone tab.
Milestone Amount filed added to the “Details” tab
Milestone Amount Validations
Provus users are able to define the Milestone amounts for each Milestone on a specific quote. The system tracks Milestone amounts for each Milestone entered on the Milestone tab. In the event the user enters total milestones in excess of the total quote amount the user will see an error message, “The total of milestone amounts cannot exceed the quote amount”. This enables the user to manage and monitor milestone costs in relation to the entire amount of the quote.
Error Message when Milestone amount exceeds Quote amount
Add-Ons Usability Enhancements
Add-Ons Field Name and Field Sequences
The Add-Ons tab now clearly identifies the Add-Ons items being applied to the quote. The Add-Ons fields are now identified as follows:
Add-Ons Item - Is the name of the Add-Ons Item
Frequency - specifies the frequency in which Add-ons are billed
Price Method - Identifies the price method used to calculate Add-Ons which includes:
Percent of Revenue
Per Resource
Flat Fee
Price Method % - When price method is a percent of revenue the % of revenue is applied in this column
Base Price - is the base price of the Add-ons Item
Disc % - captures any discount percentage applied to Add-Ons
Quoted Amount - Is the total quoted amount for the Add-ons line item
Total Cost - specifies the total cost of Add-ons
Margin % - is the margin % of each Add-Ons line item
Totals Row Added for Add-Ons
A “Total” row has been added to the Add-Ons tab underneath the itemization of Add-ons that have been added to the quote. The total row identifies the total “Quoted Amount”, “Total Cost” and “Margin %” for each Add-on line item. Total amount by period, period group, and quote are visible.
Image: Add Ons Field and Name Sequences with Totals Row Added
Pricing Redesign Beta Change
COLA
Admin Setup - COLA Rates by Location
The Salesforce Administrator is able to set COLA rates for specific locations so that a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is able to be applied to the cost of resources. This functionality enables organizations to plan for and manage increasing labor costs incurred in quotes. Increasing labor costs due to COLA are able to be partially or fully offset by COLA Passthrough rates applied to revenue which facilitates quote revenue increases on an annual basis.
COLA rates setup is now simplified to manage COLA rates only by country. Administrators can still create different rate card items for each state and city within a given country.
When the admin sets the COLA rates for her/his organization, the COLA Passthrough rate is automatically set to match the COLA rates, however, the Passthrough rate can be adjusted up or down based on the needs of the organization to protect against potential shrinking margins from ongoing cost increases. When the administrator adjusts the COLA Passthrough rate the background of the overridden rate is peach in color.
Set COLA rates by Location and Adjust Passthrough for Margin Protection
Manage and Apply COLA Rates
When the Salesforce Administrator has set up COLA rates, Quote Managers are able to access “COLA Rates” by selecting the “COLA Rates” menu selection. When the user selects “COLA Rates” she/he is able to see both the COLA and COLA Passthrough rates that have been set up by the administrator. If the Administrator has not specified a COLA Passthrough rate in the COLA setup menu, then the COLA Passthrough rate will be identical to the COLA rate.
The Quote Manager is able to edit the COLA passthrough rate on a quote, however, she/he is not able to edit the COLA rate. This is a rate set by the organization and to assist with proper quote governance requires authorization of an administrator to be overridden.
If no country COLA or COLA Passthrough rates have been set by the Salesforce Administrator, then the quote manager will see a warning message advising her/him to contact the administrator to set up and establish COLA rates for the country.

Location Discount Simplification
Manage Labor Discount by Location
As a quote manager, I want to be able to increase the likelihood of closing a deal. Location discounts is a powerful tool that allows me to discount resources in a specific location. When I am on the “Adjust Pricing” dialog, I am able to add a specific discount percentage to resources in a designated country. When I apply a 5% discount to resources in the United States the location discount will be applied to all line items where resources are located in the United States.
Application of Location Discounts
Volume Discount Simplification
Labor Disc - By Volume Header and Tier Changes Enable Custom Discount Pricing
When a Provus user clicks on the Labor-Disc - By Volume Radio button, they will now see the option to select an aggregation metric based on Person Periods or Labor Revenue. Provus users also have the option to select from one of the aggregation duration options which includes quote level, period level, or period group level aggregate discounting capabilities.
Volume discounting functionality affords quote managers the flexibility to incentivize customer purchasing behavior by providing custom volume discount options. The quote manager is able to use discretion in setting volume discount tiers and discount percentages and utilize this pricing capability as a tool to win deals by making real-time price adjustments.

Line Discount Inheritance
Inherit Quote Line Disc % from Quote or Location Discount
When a Provus user is on the Pricing Adjustments tab on a quote and has applied a quote level or location discount for resources, the discount percentage applied will be inherited in the discount percent column on the resource line items. When the user enters a 5% location discount for the United States, then the line item for each resource in the United States will display a line item discount of 5%. The location discount is inherited on the resource line items.
If a Provus user enters a quote level discount of 10% for all resources on the quote then a 10% line item discount shall be applied to each line item on the quote.
Users have an option to override the inherited discount % value for a given resource line item.
Example of Location Discount inherited in the quote grid line item
Contingencies in Price Breakdown
View Contingencies in Line Item Price Breakdown
When a Provus user is viewing the line item totals on my quote and the user has applied a contingency to their quote, they will now see that contingency amount in the line item price
breakdown for a specific line item.
Pricing Calculation at Resource Period Level - Enhanced Support
Quick Action Pricing Adjustments Dialog
Being able to price and adjust a quote quickly makes Provus the premier pricing tool in services quoting. Now Provus users have the ability to make on the fly pricing adjustments with the new Pricing Adjustments dialog and review the impact of those changes on the resource period level.
When a quote manager applies Quote level discount or Location discounts or Line item level discounts they are able to see the impact of the applied changes and the complete pricing calculation on the quote price breakdown table

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the November 2022 release:
Pricing
Quote Line Item Display
Quote Line Item Pricing Display has been configured to provide Provus customers a summary view of key data elements that enables users to quickly view Resource pricing for each role by skill and location while also viewing total Revenue, Cost, and Margin for the resource for the duration of the quote
The key data elements on the line item quote summary are as follows:
Show Quote Line Item Price Breakdown
When a Provus customer when desires to see a detailed breakdown of pricing adjustments for markups (COLA, Contingency) or for Discounts (Labor, Quote-Level, Location, or Line-Item), they now have the ability to drill down into pricing level breakdowns for each quote line item.
To access line item pricing detail you will simply click on the amount in the “Quoted Amount” Column and it will display a popup with line item pricing details for the specific line item selected.
Quote Item Breakdown Pricing Calculations and Transparency
Quote Item Pricing Calculations are now visible to Provus customers in the Line Item Price breakdown accessed via the quoted amount link displayed above. Calculation details and adjustment amounts provide users with transparency to each adjustment made to the quote line item.
Line Item Pricing Details are able to be viewed for each Period and/or Period group for which applicable line item adjustments are made.
Line Item Pricing with COLA for Cost and Revenue Passthrough
Current Provus COLA functionality enables customers to account for expected increases in resource cost and expenditures on a multi-year quote. Customers are able to plan for cost increases by applying an annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) rate to quotes for both Cost and as a revenue offset to protect margin.
Rates for COLA Passthrough and costs are currently able to be applied by users on the “COLA Rates Tab” via existing functionality.
The Review COLA dialog enables users to view the impact of COLA and Passthrough on the entire quote.
New capabilities allow the user to view COLA Passthrough amounts in the Line Item Price Breakdown screen and increases in total costs are now fully baked into line item price breakdown margins.
Line Item Pricing with Fixed Price Contingency
When a Provus customer sets a Fixed Price Contingency on a quote to mitigate the risk of cost overruns on a fixed price contract. A contingency percentage is applied to the base amount of the Quote and the COLA amount if applicable to mitigate against the risk of cost overruns. The quote contingency amount is now visible for each quote line item in the price breakdown.
Line Item Pricing with Line Item Discount
When a Provus customer is on a quote and applies a Line item discount to the quote, the customer is now able to see a line item price breakdown of the impact of the discount in each period and period group of the quote. Users have transparency to the application of line item discounts in the line item pricing breakdown and can see the rollup of discounts included in the Discounted Amount column of the line item price breakdown screen.
Line Item Pricing with Volume Discount Calculations
Volume Discounts provided to customers based on total headcount or based on Labor Revenue provide an excellent opportunity for Provus customers to incentivize their patrons to purchase additional products. While volume discounts are applied in aggregate based on total resource utilization for a quote, there is a need to be able to view the impact of these discounts at the line item level.
New Provus capabilities enable Provus customers to view the impact of volume discounts on a quote at the line item level and to see the impact of volume discounts in the Discounted amount column of the line item price breakdown.
Quoting and Quote Cycle Time Improvements
New Provus functionality has been added to significantly improve and reduce quote cycle times by providing the capability to simultaneously select and simultaneously add multiple resources to a quote.
Add Resources Action on Quote Grid
The ability to mass add new resources to a quote is enabled through the new “Add Resources” Tab on the quote grid. Creation of this tab provides an avenue for customers to simultaneously add multiple resources to the quote.
The user is able to view available resources from the rate card and select multiple resources to add to the quote grid by checking the box next to the resource to be added. And to add the line items to the quote the user simply clicks “Add”
Mass Add Resource Confirmation Screen
After clicking the “Add” button to add the resources to the quote, the user receives a confirmation message for them to confirm that they wish to continue with adding the resource(s) to the quote.
Mass Add Resources Text Search
When a user is on the Add Resources popup with multiple resources, Provus provides text search capabilities where the user is able to type in characters to assist in locating a resource role, a skill level, or other attributes that are helpful in identifying specific resources to be added to the quote. In the example below, the user has typed in Unite and the resources displayed are resources located within the United States. Users are able to search for a skill level, location, role, etc. by simply using the Text Search capability.
Add Resources Select Section to Add
When a user is in the Add Resources section of a quote, the user is able to add and/or edit a selection before completing mass Add Resources actions for the section.
List View Estimation, Quoting, and Product
Estimate Template List View
When a user selects “All” while viewing Estimate Templates, they will see a list of estimate templates with several column headers to provide information and attributes specific to each estimate template.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the October 2022 release:
Document Naming and Layout Enhancements
Adding Alphanumeric Naming to Documents
Provus documents including the Estimate Template, Estimate and quote are now identified with a Unique Alphanumeric identification number. The unique identification number begins with a letter, followed by a dash and then a multi-digit number.
The prefix on an alphanumeric estimate template will begin with ET, which identifies the document as an Estimate Template, prefix on an Estimate is E, which identifies the document as an estimate, and the prefix on a Quote is Q, which identifies the document as a quote
Examples of the full unique identifier for the Estimate Template, Estimate, and Quote are as follows:
ET-00005
E-00030
Q-00051
Update the Quote, Estimate, and Estimate Template ‘Details’ Layout
The Details tab of the Estimate Template, Estimate, and Quote layouts have been updated. On the Details tab of each document, Provus users will now see a description field which replaces the prior name field. The “Description” field will provide a descriptive name of the associated document.
Example of Quote Document Name located under Details tab on quote
Estimate Template
Estimate Template Name is Now Alphanumeric and Included in Estimate Template Header
The Provus Estimate Template Name has been changed from a descriptive name to an Alphanumeric identifier that identifies each estimate template using a unique ET-Sequence Number. The ET- prefix indicates to the user that the document they are working on is an Estimate Template. The Estimate Template Header will include the Header “Estimate Template” and directly under the estimate template is the alphanumeric sequence number which will look similar to ET-00030.
New Estimate Template Header and Subheader
Changes to Estimate Template Subheader
The Provus Estimate Header and Subheader have been updated to provide enhanced information to quote managers so they are able to decipher important details related to the estimate.
The Columns on the Estimate Subheader shall include the following columns:

Owner - Name of the Estimate Template Owner
Last Modified Date - The Date and time the Estimate Template was last modified
Enter a static value in Estimate Template Task Parameter
Managers of the Estimate Template are now able to enter a duration as a numeric value in the Estimate Template. The value shall be maintained in the Estimate Template when it is converted to an estimate and the duration entered in the Estimate Template will be available on the Quote. If the duration is made non-applicable at the Activity Group, Activity, or Quote level on the estimate, the duration shall be removed from the quote. When the duration for the task is returned to applicable, the static numeric duration will be visible on the quote.
Estimate
Estimate Name is Now Alphanumeric and Included in Estimate Header
The Provus Estimate Name has been changed from a descriptive name to an Alphanumeric identifier that identifies each estimate document using an E-Sequence Number. The E- prefix indicates to the user that the document they are working on is an Estimate. The Estimate Header will include the Header “Estimate” and directly under the estimate is the alphanumeric sequence number which will look similar to E-00030.
New Estimate Header and Subheader
Changes to Estimate Subheader
The Provus Estimate Header and Subheader have been updated to provide enhanced information to quote managers so they are able to decipher important details related to the estimate.
The Columns on the Estimate Subheader shall include the following columns:
Description - A descriptive name of the Estimate
Estimated Duration - The approximate duration of the work to be performed
Estimated Amount - The estimated price of the work associated with the estimate
Service - Name of the service affiliated with the Estimate
Quote - The quote associated with the estimate
Estimate Template - The Estimate Template associated with the Estimate
Quote
Quote Name is Now Alphanumeric and Included in Estimate Header
The Provus Quote Name has been changed from a descriptive name to an Alphanumeric identifier that identifies each quote document using a Q-Sequence Number. The Q- prefix indicates to the user that the document they are working on is an Estimate Quote. The Quote Header will include the Header “Quote” and directly under the Quote is the alphanumeric sequence number which will look similar to Q-00051.
New Quote Header and Subheader

The Columns on the Quote Subheader shall include the following columns:
Account - The name of the account associated with the Estimate
Quote Date - The date the quote was created
Total Amount - The total amount of the quote
Total Adjustments - The total of adjustments applied to the quote
Total Add-ons Amount - The amount of all add-ons applied to the quote
Margin % - The margin percentage applied to the quote
Estimate to Quote Conversion - Change in Calculation for Overlapping Period Duration
As a quote manager, when I have resources assigned to multiple projects, I need the ability to manage resource allocation
When a resource is allocated to an “Activity Group” on a project for a specific percentage of time, the remainder of the duration is allocated to a separate Activity Group according to the percentage of available hours.
Example:
Resource A - works 214 hours on Activity Group 1 allocated at 60% time
Resource A - works 100 hours on Activity Group 2 allocated at 50% time
The project period is managed in hours and the period is weeks
Activity Group 1 is Scope Discovery and is complete before beginning Activity Group 2
Activity Group 2 is Solution Design and begins only after Activity Group 1 is complete
Resource A shall work the following schedule:
Week 1-9 = 24 hours
Week 10 = 20 hours
Resource A schedule for week 10 on Activity Group 1 shall be as follows:
Monday = 4.8.hours
Tuesday = 4.8 hours
Wednesday = 4.8 hours
Thursday = 4.8 hours
Friday = .8 hours
Resource A schedule for week 10 on Activity Group 2 shall be as follows:
Friday 7.2 hours are available
The resource is allocated 50% to Activity Group 2
Total hours worked on Activity Group 2 are 3.6 hours

Volume discounts are able to be applied by period, period group, or at the quote level.
Up to three tiers of headcount or labor revenue volume discounts are able to be established and applied to the quote.
When volume discounts fall within the discount tier they are applied to the quote total as a volume discount for the designated period.
The quote amount is reduced by the volume discount amounts.

Location Discount
Setup and Apply Location Level Discounts
Quote Managers are now able to set up location level discounts to a quote for resources that are assigned to a specific geography.
Resource location discounts are applied as a percentage of the labor amount of the resources assigned to a location.

The total of location discounts applied to a quote are reduced from the quote total amount.
Show the Price for a Recommended Service when Added to an Opportunity
When a user is on an opportunity within Salesforce and adds a recommended service to the opportunity, the opportunity will display the price of the added service on the opportunity.
The price of the opportunity will be derived from the Provus Services Quoting tool.
Estimate
Task Duration Using Formulas
Ability to Enter a Formula and Calculate a Per Unit Duration for a Task
New functionality has been provided which allows Provus users to enter a formula string on a Task Parameter to automatically create the duration of a task.
The string can be entered on the estimate template as a simple formula.
When the Estimate Template is converted to an Estimate and proceeds through to the quote the calculation will be made directly on the task.
Enter Tokens as part of Formula to calculate Task Duration
While on an Estimate Template, a Provus user is able to set up Scope Parameters for the Entire Template, for an Activity Group, or a specific Activity.
Scope Parameters are used to identify inputs that may be used to define task durations.
Examples of Scope Parameters may include the number of users (#users), or number of documents (#documents), or number of stakeholders (#stakeholders).
You can enter this scope parameters as tokens in a string formula and make calculations by defining values to each item defined in the string formula.
Quote
Mass Upload Resources
Mass Upload Roles and Pricing Attributes on a Quote
New functionality enables a user to use a .csv file to upload several roles with pricing attributes directly into the quote grid.
The user is able to enter the role, the location, and the skill level of a resource into a .csv template and save it to their desktop.
An Upload menu option in the quote grid allows the user to directly upload the file with role information directly into the quote grid.
The user is able to view the resources after loading the roles and corresponding attribute information.
Collaboration
Review Collaborator Changes
Quote Owner is able to Review Changes by Quote Collaborator
When a Quote Collaborator submits a collaboration quote to a quote manager for review, the quote manager is provided a link above the collaboration section to review the Collaboration Quote.
Clicking on the link to the Collaboration quote takes the quote manager to the Collaboration quote.
The quote manager is able to review the changes by the Quote Collaborator before merging the changes into the quote.
Approvals
Messaging Enhancements

Quote Rejection Email
Quote managers or submitters are able to receive an email notification advising them that a quote has been rejected.
When a quote approver has rejected a quote in the system, the quote manager receives an email notification that the quote has been rejected by the approver.
The quote approver is able to enter comments regarding the reason for the rejection of the quote.
Resources
Labor in Hours
Hours populated in Quote Grid on Estimate to Quote Conversion
When creating a quote from an estimate, when a quote manager selects hours as Labor Units prior to creating the quote then the quote grid will be populated in hours rather than in FTE headcount.
Users have the ability to select whether they want to see the quote with labor units as hours or FTE headcount.
Hours populated in Quote Grid on Estimate to Quote Conversion
When creating a quote from an estimate, when a quote manager selects hours as Labor Units prior to creating the quote then the quote grid will be populated in hours rather than in FTE headcount.
Users have the ability to select whether they want to see the quote with labor units as hours or FTE headcount.
Partial Resource Support
Change Resource from Full-Time to Part-Time for a Specified Duration
When creating an estimate, a quote manager is able to identify a resource as a partial resource at the activity group level.
The process for designating the number of hours for the resource in the estimate remains unchanged.
The Quote Manager is now able to specify the percentage of availability to assign to the resource (example: 25%, 40%, 50%, etc.).
The resource hours are then allocated to the quote grid based upon the percentage of time the resource is allocated to the project.
As an example of this feature: If a resource is allocated for 360 hours to a project at 50% availability; then the estimate will convert the resource allocation to 80 hours per month for four months.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the June 2022 release:
Add Scope Parameters to an Estimate Template
When you are on an
Estimate Template
, you now have the ability to identify and define
Scope
Parameters
that you would like to add to the template.
Scope parameters are able to be added to the entire estimate template, or to an Activity Group, or Activity within the template. When setting scope parameters you are able to identify the following actions with the parameter:
Parameter Name - Brief Parameter Name
Hashtag - Identifier
Guidance - Identifier of hashtag usage or user direction (brief)
Data Type
Checkbox (No Add Value Option)
Integer (No Add Value Option)
Integer Tiers (Able to specify tier values)
Picklist (Able to identify Picklist options)
A
+
action menu enables you to add additional Scope parameters to the Estimate Template, Activity Group, or Activity.
Scope Parameter Data Elements
Scope Parameter Data Types
Scope Discovery on the Estimate Template
When you are on an Estimate, you will notice you have a new menu option for
Scope Discovery.
As a prerequisite to this functionality you will need to populate one or more scope parameters on your Estimate Template.
Estimate Template options to Add/Edit Scope Parameters
After populating the Scope Parameters when you create an Estimate, the
Scope Discovery
button will appear on the newly created Estimate. Clicking on scope discovery will lead you through a series of questions to set up to further define scope parameter values on your estimate.
Scope Discovery on Estimate
As you navigate through each Scope Discovery question, you will have the opportunity to set threshold values for each scope discovery question whether assigned from a Checkbox, Integer, Integer Tier, or Picklist. While setting custom thresholds in the
Estimate,
while
editing the scope parameter for
Activity Groups
and
Activities
you will only be able to add custom values to the Integer Tiers, and Picklists.
You will notice that as you complete each question in the Scope Discovery process, you will click
Next
to continue through the process until it is complete.
Scope Discovery Self-Directed Questions
Link Task Parameters to Scope Parameters on Estimate Template
When you have established scope parameters on an
Estimate Template,
you now have an option to directly link Task Parameters to these scope parameters in your estimate template. When you click on
Task Parameters
you will notice a link in the field where you name the task parameter. Clicking on this link will allow you to link the task parameter to a previously defined
Scope Parameter.
Link a Task Parameter to a Scope Parameter on the Estimate Template
Ability to Add Recurring Time to Resources on a Quote
When you are on a quote and you have constant resource duration or resource recurrence on the quote; you now have the ability to add recurring hours directly to the resource on the quote which will automatically populate the quote grid.
You can access this functionality by right clicking on the resource and then selecting
Add Recurring Hours.
Add Recurring Hours for a Resource
An
Add Recurring Hours
dialog opens and I am able to establish the recurring hours I would like to add to a resource on a quote. You will see field
Hours per Occurrence.
In this dialog you enter the number of hours you want the resource to be available.
The next field is
How often does this occur?
This question asks you how often do you want the recurring hours to occur during the period. If you enter 160 hours for the period and you enter occurrence as 2 times this means that a total of 320 hours will be added for the period, whether the period is defined as annual, quarter, months, or weeks.
You will next be asked to define the frequency of occurrences within the quote. This will generally be limited to the frequency you are already using in your quote. As an example, if you are reporting in months the frequency selection will be
Months
. If you are reporting in Weeks, the frequency selection will be weeks.
The final question on the dialog is
Max Number of Occurrences
. This is not a mandatory field. If not populated the recurring hours will be populated for the duration of the quote. If populated, then the duration of the recurring hours will end with the maximum number of periods defined.
Finally, calculations will be confirmed in headcount. If you entered 40 hours, 1 time per period then the resource calculation will be displayed as .25 headcount for the month. If you entered 160 hours then the resource headcount will be 1.0 headcount for the month.
Add Recurring Hours dialog
Review COLA Rates and Calculation Summaries on a Multi-year Quote
Fluctuations in resource costs and increasing cost pressures can create significant margin pressures on multi-year quotes. Provus has added this functionality to enable you to model expected resource cost increases over the duration of a quote. These calculations are now able to be directly incorporated into your quote.
Calculations for increasing resource costs over time are referred to as a Cost of Living Adjustment or (
COLA
).
When you have prepared a multi-year quote you will have an option to select a
Review COLA
dropdown menu option. When you click on this option, a worksheet is displayed showing the impact of COLA on your quote based on COLA rates by location previously setup by your organization’s Quote Administrator.
To view my organization’s preset COLA Rates, I select the arrow next to the delta icon and click on
Review COLA.
Review COLA menu option
Clicking on the Review COLA menu option opens a
COLA Adjustment Worksheet
which allows you to see the impact of organizational COLA rates on your quote. COLA rates are also able to be defined by the geographic location of resources so you can anticipate cost fluctuations where resource costs are rising quickly or more slowly over time.
COLA Adjustment Worksheet
The worksheet displays the rate applied to quote resources by geographic location and the financial impact of COLA rates on costs over time.
Once you have reviewed and verified the COLA impacts you are able to click the
Save
action menu which will save the COLA calculations to your quote. This will reflect a change in quote
margin
as COLA has a direct impact on Costs over time and will impact margin and
not Revenue
.
COLA Rate Override Action Menu
When you review a quote and want to see the impact of COLA on your quote, have the option to view the default COLA Rates set by your organization and an edit option to edit the rates in the event there are factors that may increase or decrease the rates from the global default settings.
To access the menu to review and Override COLA rates, you will need to click on the
COLA Rates
menu option. This will open a dialog that displays the default COLA rates and an edit icon that allows you to edit the COLA rates that will be applied to your quote.
COLA Rates Menu
When you are on the COLA rates menu you will see an edit icon in the column next to the global default rates set by your organization. When click on the edit icon you, an adjust COLA Rates dialog will appear and you will have the option to enter a rate that differs from the organizational default COLA rate for the resource location(s).
Adjust COLA Rates dialog
You will not that you will not have access to the
Review
or
Save
menu options unless you have made a change to the applied COLA rates. You do this by clicking in the override column and editing the rate. Once you have edited one or more rates, then you will be able to click on the
Review
or
Save
action menus.
Clicking on
Review
opens the
COLA Adjustment Worksheet
and if you want to update the quote you are able to do so by clicking on the
Save
button while in the worksheet.
If you simply want to apply changes to the quote without viewing the worksheet. You can directly save the changes made in the
Adjust COLA rates
dialog.
Making COLA rate adjustments in the Adjust Cola Rates dialog
Adding Contingencies for Fixed Bid Quotes
When creating fixed bid quotes it is important to account for contingencies. These can come in the form of Labor Contingencies, Add-on Contingencies, or general quote level contingencies.
Provus has now added the capability to apply any of these contingencies on
Fixed Bid Quotes.
To access contingencies when you are on a quote, you click on the
Contingencies
button which will open a
Manage Contingencies
dialog.
Access Contingencies button on Quote
When you are in the dialog you have the option to apply a contingency percentage or a contingency amount to each line item on the dialog. Application of the contingency will increase the contingency by the corresponding percentage or amount.
Manage Contingency dialog
Adjustments for contingencies made to Labor, Add-ons, or to the Quote total, will be updated to the Quote Header after you hit the
Save
action menu.
Quote Header Updated with Contingency Adjustments
Ability to Source Partner Resources for a Quote
When you need to pull in specialists or niche resources from business partners, Provus now enables you to identify these resources on a rate sheet and provides visibility to these resources on the quote grid as well.
When you are adding a resource to a customer rate card a checkbox has been added that enables you to identify the resource as a
Partner Resource
. Partner resources can be identified with a
Y
or
N
selection in the drop down menu.
Partner Resource identification on Rate Card
Now that the partner resource has been identified on the rate card, a column will appear on the quote to show that the resource is affiliated with a partner.
Partner Resource Identification
Improvements
Time Periods and Time Period Group Method, and Start/End Date Cannot be Edited after Quote is Created
When a system administrator sets Time Periods, Time Period Group Methods, and Start and End Dates for a quote, you will notice that users are no longer able to edit the date in these fields if they do not have system administrator privileges.
This is designed as a security feature to manage quote integrity.
No Edit Capability without Admin Access for Time Period Alignment, Time Period, or Time Period Group Method

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the May 2022 release:
Hide the New Quote Action when an Estimate is associated with a Quote
After you create a quote from an estimate, the newly created quote is automatically linked to the source estimate from which it was created. This functionality clearly links a quote that has been created to its source estimate. This capability restricts users from inadvertently creating multiple new quotes from an estimate and requires the user to de-link a quote from an estimate prior to creating a new quote from the estimate.
When you want to create a new estimate from a quote, you will see a
New Quote
menu option in the top right of the Estimate page that you can click to create a new quote.
This is existing Provus functionality.
Current Functionality: Create a
New Quote

Estimate.
New Quote
Menu action is hidden after quote is created, and an action is added to
De-Link the Estimate
from the quote is provided
You will notice when your quote is in sync with an estimate that there is an option to
De-link Estimate
, it is this functionality that de-links the estimate from the quote.
After the quote is de-linked from a corresponding estimate you will have the ability to create a new quote from that estimate.
Enhance Estimate Header for Easy Access to Quote
Now you have easier access to transition from an Estimate to its corresponding quote if the quote has already been created.
When you view the
Estimate Header
, you are able to see a link to the corresponding Quote, if a quote has been created from the Estimate you are viewing.

Clone the associated estimate when creating a new scenario
When negotiating with a client, there are times when you need the ability to view different scenarios that help you assist the client in reaching their goals. Cloning an estimate to change durations and headcount dynamics allows you this flexibility.
If you need to shorten the duration you can create alternative estimate scenarios in which you increase the number of resources on estimate to complete the work faster. Cloning the Estimate functionality allows you to quickly create and view alternative pricing scenarios.

De-Link Estimate
from Quote
Restrict Duration Column Editing for a Quote with an Associated Estimate
Issues were reported where quotes created from an Estimate were able to be edited directly in the Quote instead of in the estimate. This caused the quote and estimate to be out of sync. Now you
are not able
to edit period durations directly in the
quote
if the quote is tied to an estimate.
Unable to Estimate Period Duration when Estimate is tied to Quote (Cell is locked)
Removed non-billable resources from quote header calculations
An issue with resources who have been made non-billable has been resolved and now when a resource is made non-billable, the resource is not counted in revenue on the quote, however, the cost of the resource is included in margin calculations. Adding costs of a non-billable resource to a quote will reduce the margin on the quote.
Resolved Issue where Total Estimate Cost Displays '0' if default attributes are populating from Estimate Template to Estimate
The issue has been resolved and the Total Estimate cost now reflects the actual estimated costs of the estimate when default Resource Role attributes are populated from the estimate template. You should notice that estimate costs regardless of the source of the resource attributes that have been applied via the
Estimate
or
Estimate Template.
Resolved Issue where user was unable to save Resource Role Preferences while creating a Quote from an Estimate
Improvements
Make Resources on a Quote Non-Billable
Users reported a need to show resources who will participate in work done on a quote, but who are non-billable to the quote customer. This capability has been added and you now have the option to right-click on a Resource in a quote and make the resource non-billable.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the December 2024 release:
Functional Enhancements - Quotes
Configure Quote as Read-Only based on Quote Status
As a Provus admin, you can configure the quote status so that the quote will be read-only. This ensures that users cannot edit quotes with certain statuses.
As a Provus admin, you can configure the
Quote Field API Name for Read-only
in Provus Setup.
You can enter the API name of the boolean field (either a custom or standard field).
The quote is rendered as read-only if the boolean field is set to true.
Both estimate-based and staffing quotes are rendered as non-read-only if the boolean field is set to false, if the field API name is incorrect, or if the field is not boolean.
All the estimate components and quote components are auto-refreshed whenever any change is made to the field specified for Read-only Quote.
For configuration information, refer to:
Configure Estimate Based Quotes
Configure Staffing (Direct) Quotes
Ability to make Quote Item Disc % Read-Only
As a Provus admin, you can configure Discount % in custom metadata, allowing you to control the field’s visibility and read-only status.
In custom metadata for the Resource Allocation Card, Quote Configurator Card, and Quote Configurator, you can configure the Discount % field to be read-only or editable.
For configuration information, refer to:
Configure Discount Percentage as Read-Only
Change Service Start Date During Estimate-Based Quote Creation (Quote from Template)
As a sales user, you can change the service start date when you create an estimate template based quote using the “Quote from Quote Template” option. This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable quote from quote template with estimate
.”
When you are on the quote from quote template dialog:
You can select a new service start date.
You can create a quote with this selected service start date.
The selected Service Start Date will automatically update the Start Date on services for both the weekday and user-defined calendars.
Suppose you have a quote with 2 services and each service has a different start date as shown in the table below:
Action/Details
Service
Start Date
Days Difference
Initial Quote with 2 services.
Service 1
4th Nov 2024
16 Days
Service 2
20th Nov 2024
Quote Template
Service 1
15th Nov 2024
5 Days
Service 2
20th Nov 2024
Quote from Quote Template
Service 1
15th Jan 2025
5 Days
Service 2
20th Jan 2025
This functionality applies to both quote templates with a weekday calendar and those with a user-defined calendar and is supported in both the dialog and wizard flow for Quote from Quote Template creation.
Fields on Quotes now Retained When Template is Changed
As a sales user, you can see the Opportunity and Account even if the quote template is populated, changed, or cleared. This ensures that you do not need to select those fields again.
If a quote from a quote template is created from an Opportunity:
The Account and Opportunity are retained when the quote template is changed, even if the quote template has Opportunity or Account populated.
On the "Quote from Quote Template" dialog or header fields screen in the wizard, if the Description and Service Start Date are configured in metadata, the metadata values are set by default and are not changed or cleared even when the quote template is changed or cleared.
Values for Description and Service Start Date passed in the URL will override the values set in metadata.
If the selected Quote Template has an account-specific rate card, and if the account selected on the "Quote from Quote Template" step or dialog is different, the following error message is displayed when you click "Save/Create Quote": “
Select quote template that has rate card associated with the selected account
.”
Steps
:
Configure defaultValue for description in the custom metadata > CreateServiceQuoteFromTemplate.
"description"
:
{
"visible"
:
true
,
"readonly"
:
false
,
"defaultValue"
:
{
"expression"
:
"Quote for Opportunity.Name"
}
}
,
JSON
Copy
Choose “Quote From Quote Template” in the Create Services Quote wizard. By default, the description is set as defined in the metadata configuration.
Search for and select any quote template. The description is updated to reflect the template's description.
Functional Enhancements - Resources & Mass Effort Change
Retain Resource Selection on Add Resources & Mass Effort Update Dialog for Direct Quotes
As a Provus user, you can keep your selection of resources when you perform a search in the Add Resources and Mass Effort Update dialog. This feature allows you to search and add multiple resources to your quote.
This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable Retain Resource Selection on Add Resources Dialog.
” By default, the flag is off.
When you are on the Add Resources or Mass Effort Update dialog, you can select multiple resources, and the selection of resources is retained in all the following cases:
You search with different text
You cancel the search
You return to the selection
Clone Quote API
Support for Custom Fields in Clone Quote API
As an API user, you can now pass custom field values to the Clone Quote API, so that you can update specific fields to disable validation rules that you have defined.
The Clone Quote API accepts a set of custom fields and their values as part of the API request payload.
The specified custom fields are applied to the cloned quote during the cloning process.
Fields not specified in the request payload are left unchanged during cloning.

Usability Enhancements
Clear Visibility of Editable Status in Quote Grid and Add-Ons Grid Cells
As a sales user, you can see clearly if the quote grid and add-on cells are editable or not so that you don't need to click on each cell to know whether it is editable. This is behind the beta flag - “
Show read-only fields greyed out on quote grid
.”
Quote Grid Cells:
When you are on any quote grid components of the estimate-linked quote, you can see clearly that the following columns are editable if these fields are not marked read-only using a read-only persona, status-based read-only, or metadata configuration:
Base Price
Base Cost
Disc %
Quote Item Custom fields
Additionally, you can see the following columns as non-editable:
Section
Role
Rate Card Attributes (like Location, Skill, Band, etc.)
Total Person (Labor units)
Quoted Price
Quoted Amount
Total Cost
Margin %
Period
Period Groups
When you are on any quote grid components of the non-estimate linked quote, you can see clearly that the following columns are editable if these fields are not marked read-only using a read-only persona, status-based read-only, or metadata configuration:
Base Price
Base Cost
Disc %
Quote Item Custom fields
Period
Additionally, you can see the following columns as non-editable:
Section
Role
Rate Card Attributes (like Location, Skill, Band, etc.)
Total Person (Labor units)

The following columns are editable:
Add-Ons Items
Frequency
Price Method %
Quantity Per Occurrence
Base Price
Disc %
Period
Period Groups
The following columns are non-editable:
Total Quantity
Quoted Amount
Total Cost
Margin %
Total Amount (USD)
Volume Discounts: Validations for Tier and Discount Values
As a Provus user, you will receive a warning if you enter invalid tier values or Discount %, ensuring that you do not input incorrect tier information.
Validation applies for all possible values for Aggregation Metric and Aggregation Duration:
If you enter 3 or more decimals in the Discount % field and move away from the field, an inline validation message will display: “Value can only have 2 decimals.”
If you enter a ‘To’ value that is less than or equal to the ‘From’ value (with or without decimals), an inline validation will appear: “'To' value should be greater than 'From' value.”
If you enter a decimal value in the ‘To’ field (even if greater than the ‘From’ value), a message will display: “The value should be integer only.”
All messages can be customized using the custom label/translation workbench.
From
To
Message
10001
5000.02
‘To’ value should be greater than ‘From’ value
10001
15001.02
The value should be Integer only
10001
10001
‘To’ value should be greater than ‘From’ value
Configurable Sections Labels on Summary tab for Non-estimate based Quotes
As a Provus admin, you can change the label for the ‘resource’/'resource role’ as per business needs on the Summary tab. You can modify ‘resource’, ‘resources', and 'resource role' using a custom label such that the new label is reflected on:
Resource Role in Resource Role Summary
Resource Role (Displayed) Summary
Label Changed:
Configure Fields on Add and Edit Resources Dialog
As a Provus admin, you can show or hide columns on the ‘Add resources’/‘Edit resource’ dialog as per business needs.
You can configure the following columns in a single custom metadata configuration for the Add resources and Edit resource dialogs. By default, all fields are visible.
Unit Price
Unit Cost
Price UOM
Margin Percent
Location Country
Location State/Province
Location City
Suppose you want to hide the
Price UOM
field on the Add resources and Edit resource dialog.
Add resources
dialog:
Edit resource
dialog:
The
Price UOM
column
is
hidden on the Add resources dialog.
The
Price UOM
column is hidden on the Edit resource dialog.
Ability to View and Edit custom fields for add-on quote items on quote grid
As a Provus user, you can view and update custom add-on item fields so that you can capture the add-on details as per your needs.
This feature is controlled by the feature flag: “
Enable: custom fields for add-ons
.”
When you are on the add-on grid, you can see the custom fields (added to Quote Item) displayed as columns on the add-on quote grid based on the component settings.
To configure custom fields on the quote grid, refer to -
Configu
re Custom Fields
.
The following field types are supported:
Picklist
Checkbox
Text / Number
Date
On the add-on grid:
You can edit the fields, and the field value is saved when you select or enter the value.
Default values for fields will be taken from the object manager field definition.
The admin can configure the custom fields by setting them as:
Visible/Hidden
Read-Only
Default
Ordered in a specific sequence (priority)
Custom field columns will appear before the "Base Price" column.
View Quote Header Price Breakdown
As a Quote Manager, you need your quote amount to reconcile with the Labor and Add-ons breakdown so that your customers and you can have confidence in quote accuracy and pricing validity.
This is behind a beta flag - “
Enable Quote Header Price Breakdown
.”
On the Quote, you will see the
Total Amount
field as a hyperlink on the quote header.
When you click the hyperlink, it opens the
Labor amount breakdown
dialog with the following details:
All Columns and Rows are customizable using a custom label/translation workbench.
Columns:
Price Point
and
Totals
Rows:
Total Person <Units>

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the February 2025 release:
Usability Enhancements
Search Functionality for Add-Ons in the Add Add-Ons Dialog
As a Provus user, you can search for add-ons when adding them to a quote, so that you can easily find the required add-on. This feature is controlled by the feature flag: “
Enable: Search Add-ons
.”
When you are on the
Add Add-Ons
dialog, you will see a new search box with the following capabilities:
You can search using multiple words.
The search filters rows that match all the words across all columns in the Add Add-Ons table.
If you select an add-on and then clear the search, your selection will remain.
If you have already selected add-ons and then perform a search, your earlier selections will still be retained.
Select Values for Service Category on Create Services Quote Wizard Step 2
As a Provus user, you can multi-select values for the service categories on the Create Services Quote wizard in step 2, so that you do not need to select the values again in step 3.
The Provus admin can make the following configurations in the Provus Component Configuration metadata:
CreateServiceQuoteDetail:
You can configure the following for a component:
Show/hide
Single select/multi-select
CreateServiceQuoteSelect
You can configure the following for a component:
Show/hide
Single select/multi-select
If a component is added to both CreateServiceQuoteDetail and CreateServiceQuoteSelect:
The value(s) selected in both instances are kept in sync.
The value(s) selected in Step 3 are visible in Step 2 when you click “Previous.”
If the component is used as a filter in step 3, the filter is applied or modified according to the selection of values made in step 2.
The Provus admin can configure the service category selection component in Step 2 and Step 3 of the Create Services Quote wizard in various ways. The table below outlines all possible combinations, along with their configurations, user experience, and behavior.

Changes made in Step 3 are reflected in Step 2 when navigating back.
For configuration information, refer to -
Configure Service Categories Selection on Quote Wizard Step 2 & 3
Ability to Make the Service Category Field Mandatory
As a Provus admin, you can mark the Service Category field as mandatory in Step 2 of the Create Services Quote wizard. This ensures that sales users must select a value, preventing all services from appearing in Step 3.
In Create Services Quote Details metadata, configure whether the Service Category component is mandatory or not.
If the component is configured as mandatory, the field is displayed with a red asterisk.
If you click
Next
on step 2 of the wizard without selecting the service category value,  an inline error message  ‘Complete this field’ is displayed on the field.
Note
: The Service Category field is not mandatory in Step 3 of the wizard.
For
configuration
information, refer to:
Configure Service Category Field as Mandatory on Quote Wizard Step 2
Functional Enhancements
Display Quote Summary Components Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
As a Provus admin user, you can show/hide the components on the quote summary tab based on the visibility expression so that the sales user does not see unnecessary information.
You can show/hide based on the visibility expression with the following features:
Support logical conditions on the Quote fields using their API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__esitmateId__c, BillingType__c)
If the condition is evaluated as true, the component is displayed on the quote; otherwise, it is hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error is displayed when opening a quote.
This configuration applies to both non-estimate and estimate-based quotes.
Suppose you want to show the Resource Allocation card on the quote summary only when the Quote status is “Draft”.
Quote Status is
Draft
: The
Resource Allocation
card is visible on the quote summary.
Quote Status is
Approved
: The
Resource Allocation
card is hidden on the quote summary.
For configuration information, refer to:
Quote Summary Components Visibility Based on Filter Expressions
Display Quote Item Fields Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
As a Provus admin user, you can show or hide fields on the quote grid based on the visibility expression. This ensures that sales users do not see unnecessary fields.
You can configure fields shown on the quote grid (via Provus Component Configurations: QuoteAncillaries, QuoteConfigurator, QuoteConfiguratorCard, ResourceAllocationCard) with the following capabilities:
Ability to show or hide fields based on the visibility expression, with the following features:
Support for logical conditions on Quote fields using API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__EstimateId__c, BillingType__c). Example expression: “PSQ__QuoteType__c.PSQ__TimePeriod__c == Quarters”.
Ability to use Product fields, Standard fields, or Custom fields in the visibility expression.
If the condition is evaluated as true, the field is displayed; otherwise, it is hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error is displayed when the quote is opened.
This configuration applies to both non-estimate and estimate-based quotes. It does not apply to the Resource Role and Rate Card attribute group columns.
Suppose you want to show the Base Price column on the quote grid only when the Quote period is set as “Quarters”.
Quote Period is Quarters: The
Base Price
column is visible.
Quote Period is Months: The
Base Price
column is hidden.
For configuration information, refer to:
Quote Item Field Visibility Based on Filter Expressions
Display Quote Tabs Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
As a Provus admin user, you can now show or hide tabs on quotes/estimates to ensure that sales users only see relevant tabs.
You can configure the tabs displayed on quotes/estimates with the following capabilities:
Ability to show or hide tabs based on a visibility expression.
Support for logical conditions using Quote fields with API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__estimateId__c, BillingType__c). Example: PSQ__QuoteType__c == "True"
Use of Product, Standard, or Custom fields in the expression.
If the condition evaluates to true, the tab is displayed; otherwise, it remains hidden.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error message will be displayed when opening the quote.
This configuration applies to both direct non-estimate and estimate-based quotes.
Suppose you want to hide the Scope tab when the quote status is “Approved”.
Quote status is
Draft
: The
Scope
tab is visible.
Quote status is
Approved
: The
Scope
tab is hidden.
For configuration information, refer to:
Hide Quote Tabs Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
Configure Quote Header Fields for Different Quote Types
The Quote Header Fields section displays ten fields by default for all types of quotes. In some cases, you may want to display a different set of fields on the quote header based on the type of quote.
For example, if you are working with a Managed Services Quote, you might need to show specific fields that differ from those in a Professional Services Quote. By configuring the quote header fields accordingly, you can ensure that users see only the most relevant information for each quote type.
This configuration applies to both non-estimate and estimate-based quotes.
For configuration information, refer to -
Configure Quote Header Fields for Different Quote Types
Ability to Add Add-Ons Using Custom Workflow
As a Provus user, you can now add and manage custom add-ons in your quotes for greater flexibility. For example, you can add a new
Create Add-ons
button to the Quote page, allowing you to easily add and customize additional options as needed.
Clicking the Create-Add-ons button allows you to create a new category and type of add-on item.
Refer to -

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the March 2025 release:
Functional Enhancements
Setup Working Hours by Country - Schedule Settings
To improve quote accuracy, the Provus admin can now view and modify country-specific labor working hours. This enhancement ensures that calculated hours on quotes reflect accurate regional labor standards.
This feature is controlled by the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Working Hours by Country
”, which is disabled by default.
Key Features
:
Country-Based Configuration: Admins can view and modify labor working hours for specific countries.
Accurate Hour Calculation: Ensures that hours calculated on the quote align with defined country-specific working hours.
Field Details
:
Hours in a standard day
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a standard week
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a standard month
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Hours in a standard year
: Editable numeric field with five decimal precision.
Country
: Editable picklist field populated with country values (using the global picklist).
This enhancement allows organizations to tailor working hour calculations to regional labor norms, improving quote accuracy and consistency.
To set country country-specific working hours, refer to:
Setup Working Hours by Country
Calculate End Dates Using Country-Specific Working Hours
Expanding on the country-specific working hours feature, Provus now supports calculating quote end dates using these custom settings.
This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable Working Hours by Country
.” By default, the flag is off.
Key Details
:
When a quote is created or updated, hours per period are calculated based on the resource's country/location and the specified working hours instead of the default schedule settings in custom metadata.
If no country is specified, the global schedule settings will apply.
If both country-specific and global (non-country-specific) working hours are defined, country-specific hours take precedence.
Hours calculation and end date calculation logic based on the weekday or user-defined calendar remain unchanged.
Scenarios where the Ignore Carryover Hours beta feature flag is OFF are not included in this update.
Note:
This feature applies to both the weekday calendar and user-defined calendars.
Convert Base Price and Base Cost on Quote Items Using Country-Specific Working Hours
Provus now introduces improved conversion logic for Quote Item Base Price and Base Cost calculations using country-specific working hour settings. This feature is controlled by the beta feature flag "
Enable Working Hours by Country
", which is disabled by default.
Key Details
:
When a quote is created or updated, the conversion logic of Quote Item Base Price and Base Cost now considers schedule settings based on custom metadata with country-specific working hours.
Conversion applies when the Rate Card Item UoM differs from the Quote UoM.
If no country is specified, the global schedule settings are applied.
If both country-specific and global (non-country-specific) working hours are defined, country-specific hours take precedence.
Example Calculation
:
India Working Hours:
6 hours/day
30 hours/week
120 hours/month
1440 hours/year
Scenario:
Rate Card UoM: Daily
Quote UoM: Weekly
Rate Card Price: $800 per day
Calculation
:Working Days per Week = 30 hours/week ÷ 6 hours/day = 5 days
Base Price (Weekly) = 800 × 5 = $4000
This enhancement streamlines pricing conversions, improving quote accuracy and aligning with regional labor standards.
Display the Markup/Discount Options Based on Visibility Filter Expression
As a Provus Admin, you can now control the visibility of markup and discount options based on a defined visibility expression. This enhancement ensures that sales users only see relevant information, improving the user experience and reducing unnecessary complexity.
Key Capabilities:
Configure COLA, Contingency, Volume Discounts, Location Discounts, and Tiered Discounts in the Adjust Pricing dialog to be shown or hidden based on a visibility expression.
Support for logical conditions on Quote fields using API names (e.g., PSQ__QuoteType__c, PSQ__estimateId__c, BillingType__c).
Example: PSQ__QuoteType__c == "True"
If the condition is true, the option is displayed; otherwise, it is hidden.
If an expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error will be displayed when opening a quote.
This configuration applies to both direct quotes and estimate-based quotes.
Example Use Case
:
Suppose you want to show the Discounts tab in the Adjust Pricing dialog only when the Time Periods Group is “Year”.
Time Periods Group:
Year
Discount
tab is visible.
Time Periods Group:
Quarters
Disounts
tab is hidden.
For configuration information, refer to:
Hide Markup/Discount Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
Apply COLA from Service Month specified in COLA setup
As a sales user, you can apply COLA with effect from a specified month so that it aligns with the financial year of each country.
This feature is controlled by the beta flag: “
Enable: Service Month for COLA
.”
If COLA with a service month is set up and a multi-year quote is created, updated, or opened:
The COLA amount and COLA passthrough for quote line items are calculated based on the Service Month for the corresponding Resource Location Country, as specified in the COLA rates by location.
Prices are then recalculated accordingly.
Note:
COLA applies to periods where the period start date falls on or after the first day of the COLA service month, beginning in the second year of the quote. The second year is determined based on the quote's service start date. If the COLA service month is not defined, the COLA service month defaults to January.
Usability Enhancements
Enhanced Visibility for Selected Scenario Cards
As a Provus user, you can now easily identify the selected scenario card with improved visual clarity. This feature is behind the feature flag: “
Enable New Scenario Cards
.”
When you select a scenario card on the quote:
The selected card is displayed with a blue background. The non-selected cards appear with a white background.
All scenario cards have a consistent size for a uniform look.
If the description text exceeds the available space, it will be truncated as per the design guidelines.
The Total Cost field is now aligned with the Description for improved readability.
Beta Features
The following beta features are now generally available:
Custom fields for quote resources
Increase height of the quote grid components
Long text field for formula builder

Release Process

Type of Release

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the April 2025 release:
Functional Enhancements
Set Default Values for Custom Fields on Quote Grid
As a Provus admin, you can now set default values for custom fields when adding a new resource quote item to a quote. This eliminates the need to set values manually, saving you time and reducing errors.
When you add a resource quote item to a quote, the quote item will automatically apply the default values for custom fields as defined in the custom metadata settings.
Note:
This configuration applies to non-estimate (direct) based quotes.
To configure default values for custom fields on the quote grid, refer to -
Configure Custom Fields Defaut Value
Support for Using Working Hours by Country with Carryover Hours Enabled
As a Provus admin, you can now view and update labor working hours by country, ensuring that the hours calculated on quotes accurately reflect country-specific labor schedules.
This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Working Hours by Country
”, which is turned off by default.
Additionally, carryover hours are now supported for quotes using single-country working hours schedule settings.
Feature Overview:
When the
Ignore Carryover Hours
flag is set to
OFF
, resources can maximize their productivity by utilizing any unused hours within the same week. This enables seamless transitions between activity groups, ensuring efficient use of resource time.
Ignore Carryover Hours -
OFF (for non-custom services only)
Note:
For services with a
Custom
project duration and top-down duration enabled, effort is distributed evenly across the defined time periods. Carry-over hours are not considered, and the distribution strictly follows a top-down duration approach. For more information, refer to -
Project Schedule
Ability to Update Add-ons Base Price and Base Cost When Rate Card Item Price/Cost Are Updated
As a sales user, you can view the updated Base Price/Base Cost for add-ons.
This is behind the beta feature - “
Enable: Add-Ons Price and Cost Update from Rate Card
.”
On opening the quote, if the rate card item base price/base cost is different from the quote item base price/base cost, the add-ons base price/base cost are updated and you will see the following message:
Before Rate Card Prices are Changed
:
After Rate Card Prices are Changed
:
The Quoted Amount, Total Cost, and Margin% are shown according to the updated Base Price/Base Cost.
Note:
For read-only users, the base price/base cost are not updated for add-ons even if the rate card item prices are different from the quote item price.
Enhanced Control to Show/Hide Summary Tables on the Summary Tab
As a Provus admin, you can now configure the visibility of summary tables on the
Summary
tab. This customization ensures that users only see the tables set as visible based on your preferences and business requirements.
This feature applies to both Direct and Estimate-based quotes.
You can define the visibility filters using expressions to control which tables are shown through component settings. When users access the Summary tab of a quote, they will see the summary tables based on the configured settings.
You can configure the following Summary tables:
Quote Totals
Resource Role Summary
Resource Role (Displayed) Summary
Period Group Summary
Location Summary
Section Summary
Managed Services Summary
To configure the summary tables, refer to -
Hide Pricing Summary Tables Based on Visibility Filter Expressions
.
Support for Hyperformula for Fields on Quote Grid
As a Provus admin, you can set values for fields in the quote grid using HyperFormula with the following capabilities:
Define HyperFormula in the custom metadata settings.
Support for all mathematical operators and functions available in HyperFormula.
Use fields from the Quote Item, Quote, Estimation Input Parameter (using hashtags), and Rate Card Item (linked to Quote Item) with API names.
Example: PSQ__TotalPersonUnit__c + PSQ__TotalAdjustments__c, Count__c * PSQ__TotalPersonUnit__c.
If the formula evaluation is successful, the evaluated values are displayed in the quote grid based on the formula defined in the custom metadata settings.
If the expression contains a syntax error or is invalid, an error message will be displayed when opening the quote.
This configuration applies to both direct quotes and estimate-based quotes.
If a default value property and a formula are both set for a custom field, the formula takes precedence.
Note:
This feature is applicable to custom fields.
To define the hyper formula, refer to:
Configure Hyper Formula for Fields on Quote Grid
Mass Effort/ Mass Resources Update Accessible via Mass Change Action
As a Quote Manager, you can now perform mass effort updates for non-estimate based quotes, using the
Mass Change
action instead. The Mass Effort Update button will no longer be visible.
The new
Mass Change
button is available in the following locations:
On the
Resource Allocation
card on the
Quote Summary
tab.
On the
Labor Pricing
subtab under the
Pricing
tab.
When you click the Mass Change button and select a resource to update, you will see two options:
Change Resource Details
Change Effort
You can choose to update either the effort or the resource details as needed.
Note:
The underlying Mass Effort Update functionality remains unchanged.
For more information, refer to:

A push upgrade is a method of automatically upgrading your sandboxes and production environments to a newer version of the package. This is to ensure all customers are using the same or latest version.
All Provus releases are push upgrades that include, major, minor, patch, and emergency releases.
Process
The push upgrade process is streamlined to ensure a smooth transition to the latest version of the Provus package across all subscribed organizations.
Here’s how it works:
Upgrade pushed to subscribed organizations
Subscribers receive upgrades without action
The version number on the Package Detail page increases
Benefits
Push upgrades offer several significant advantages that contribute to an improved customer experience and system reliability:
Minimizes risks of multiple versions
Ensures that patches and emergency fixes can be released to customers quickly
Automates post-upgrade configurations

We are excited to share the highlights of our last three releases, which have brought significant enhancements to your quoting experience.
Here's a brief overview:
Streamlined Estimate Creation:
Clearer Communication:
Sales reps can now provide clear instructions and explanations directly within estimate templates using the "Edit Guidance Text" feature. This ensures everyone involved understands the context for each parameter.
Enhanced Organization:
Effortlessly add, edit, and manage activity groups right within the estimate template with "Inline Activity Group Editing". This eliminates the need for context switching and keeps everything organized.
Improved Time Management:
Admins can define durations for activity groups directly in the template with "Specify Duration on Activity Groups," allowing for more accurate top-down time estimates.
Standardized Workflows:
Establish formulas for task durations based on activity group timings using "Standard Parameter for Task Duration". This promotes consistency and simplifies the quoting process.
Seamless Transitions:
Duration information seamlessly transfers from the template to the final estimate during conversion with "Edit Activity Group Duration," saving time and reducing errors.
Smarter Resource Allocation:
"Auto-Populate Preferred Resources" suggests suitable resources for each service based on pre-defined preferences. This streamlines resource allocation and ensures the right people are assigned to the job.
Powerful Quote Management:
Save Time, Close Deals Faster:
No more juggling multiple quote windows! "Automatic Opening of Quotes" automatically opens a single quote when creating multiple options, saving valuable time.
Enhanced Project Planning:
"Top-Down Scheduling Support in Provus" empowers you to plan projects from a high-level perspective, providing greater flexibility during the quoting phase.
Accurate Conversions:
"Custom Duration Conversion from Estimate to Quote" ensures your quote schedule reflects any adjustments made during the conversion process, guaranteeing a smooth transition.
Global Reach:
"Currency Selection during Quote Creation" allows sales reps to create quotes in different currencies, catering to international clients and simplifying the quoting process.
Scenario Versatility:
"Convert Scenario to Primary Quote" enables you to easily convert alternative pricing options (scenarios) into independent quotes for a more versatile approach.
Synchronized Opportunities:
"Sync Primary Quote to Opportunity" ensures your opportunities accurately reflect the services and pricing included in the final quote, maintaining data integrity.
Flexible Service Management:
"Change Service Start Date for Single Service Quote" provides granular control over start dates for individual services within single-service quotes.
Bulk Add-Ons, Big Savings:
Mass Add Add-Ons allows you to select and add multiple add-on services efficiently, saving valuable time and streamlining the quoting process.
Improved User Experience:
Clearer Visibility:
"Ability to Expand/Collapse Service Row on Quote Grid" creates a two-level hierarchy on the quote grid. This allows you to easily expand or collapse service rows for a cleaner view and improved navigation.

Introduction
Purpose
The purpose of this Information Security Policy is to establish guidelines and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets within Provus, a leading provider of software solutions tailored for services quoting on the Salesforce platform.
Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers working with Provus and accessing or handling information related to the development of our software on the Salesforce platform.
Regulatory Compliance
Provus is committed to complying with all relevant data protection and privacy laws, including but not limited to GDPR, HIPAA, and any industry-specific regulations applicable to professional services organizations engaged in quoting activities.
By extension, Provus ensures compliance with the high standards maintained by Salesforce. The salesforce platform adheres to several prominent compliance certifications, including but not limited to:
ISO 27001:
Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard.
SOC 1
and
SOC 2:
Service Organization Control standards ensuring the security, availability, and confidentiality of customer information.
HIPAA:
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, ensuring the protection of healthcare information.
GDPR:
General Data Protection Regulation, providing robust data protection and privacy for European Union citizens.
FedRAMP:
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, ensuring security standards for cloud services used by the U.S. government.
A detailed and updated list of Salesforce's compliance certifications and details can be found at
Salesforce Compliance
.
Information Security Objectives
Confidentiality
Provus recognizes that confidentiality is paramount in preserving the trust and security of our users. As such, we employ a multi-faceted approach to secure sensitive customer data, proprietary code, and any other confidential information assets:
Access Controls:
Robust access control mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information. Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Regular access reviews and audits are conducted to verify and validate access permissions. We invite you to review our data access control policy.
Data Classification:
Provus has implemented a comprehensive data classification policy, categorizing information based on sensitivity. This allows for targeted protection measures and ensures that the appropriate level of security controls is applied to each class of data.
Monitoring and Auditing:
Continuous monitoring of access logs and regular security audits provide insights into any anomalous activities. These measures not only detect potential security incidents but also serve as proactive measures to maintain the confidentiality of our information assets. Provus monitors its demo, quality assurance, and marketing Salesforce environments to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of information across these instances.
Integrity
Integrity is foundational to the trust our clients place in our software. Provus employs a comprehensive set of practices to maintain data accuracy and reliability particularly in relation to the generation of quotes for services organizations:
Secure Coding Practices:
Provus adheres to secure coding standards and practices to prevent vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of our software. This includes the utilization of static code analysis tools to proactively identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in both first-party (Provus-developed) and third-party (external) software components.
Version Control:
Rigorous version control mechanisms are in place to track and manage changes to our software. This not only facilitates collaboration among development teams but also ensures that the integrity of the software is maintained throughout its lifecycle.
Testing Procedures:
A robust testing framework, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, is implemented to identify and rectify any issues that could compromise the integrity of our software. This includes thorough testing of the quoting and pricing functionalities to guarantee accurate and reliable results.
Code Reviews:
Regular code reviews, conducted by cross-functional teams, serve as a critical checkpoint to validate the integrity of our codebase. This collaborative process ensures that potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before deployment.
Availability
Provus recognizes that availability is essential to providing a seamless experience for our users. To guarantee the continuous availability of our software, minimizing downtime and disruptions to our services for authorized users our approach to ensuring continuous availability includes:
Application Performance Assessments:
Regular performance assessments are conducted to identify and address any bottlenecks or potential issues that could impact the availability of our software.
Incident Response Plans:
Provus has well-defined incident response plans in place to swiftly address and mitigate any disruptions or incidents affecting the availability of our software. These plans include communication protocols, escalation procedures, and steps for rapid resolution.
Salesforce Platform Availability:
Provus software platform availability is inherently tied to the availability of the Salesforce platform. Salesforce maintains a high standard for platform availability. For a more comprehensive overview of Salesforce's system status and recommended availability best practices, please refer to
Salesforce's dedicated trust website
.
Access Controls
User Authentication
Enforce Single Sign-On (SSO) for user authentication, ensuring secure and efficient access.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Enforce the principle of least privilege by assigning roles and permissions based on job responsibilities. Regularly review and update access rights.
Account Management
Establish procedures for creating, modifying, and terminating user accounts, ensuring prompt removal of access for employees who leave the company.
Data Protection
Encryption
Safeguarding sensitive service quoting data is a paramount priority for Provus. Leveraging the Salesforce platform, Provus aims to fortify data protection through the inherent adoption of Salesforce's robust encryption practices
Salesforce Encryption Standards:
Provus adheres to and leverages the encryption standards implemented by the Salesforce platform for both data in transit and data at rest. This ensures that sensitive information processed and stored within the Salesforce environment is consistently protected through industry-leading encryption protocols. We invite you to review Salesforce’s
first party storage encryption report
.
Data Backup
Given the critical nature of the data processed by Provus, regular and reliable data backups are imperative to prevent data loss.
Salesforce Data Backup:
Provus relies on Salesforce's established data backup mechanisms to routinely and securely back up critical data. This ensures that in the event of data loss or system failure, the most recent and accurate data can be recovered promptly. For further information, please refer to Salesforce’s
Disaster Recovery and BCP
.
Data Retention and Disposal
Provus acknowledges that Salesforce allows its customers to set up and control their own data retention policies. In line with this, Provus is committed to sharing data retention best practices upon request.
Salesforce Data Retention Control:
Salesforce provides customers with the flexibility to define and manage their data retention policies. Provus, in alignment with Salesforce's practices, empowers its customers to customize data retention settings according to their specific needs.
Provus's Data Retention Best Practices:
Provus is dedicated to assisting its customers in establishing effective data retention policies. Upon request, Provus is prepared to share best practices, guidance, and insights to support customers in optimizing their data retention strategies within the Salesforce environment.
Incident Response
Incident Communication & Procedures
In the event of an incident, Provus prioritizes transparent and timely communication to mitigate risks, address concerns, and ensure the swift resolution of the situation. Our communication procedures are designed to keep all stakeholders well-informed while minimizing any potential impact on our operations and services.
Key Principles:
Rapid Notification:
Provus is committed to promptly notifying relevant internal and external parties about any incidents. This ensures that all stakeholders are aware of the situation, allowing for coordinated and immediate response efforts.
Defined Communication Channels:
Clear channels for incident communication are established, delineating responsibilities and ensuring that the right information reaches the appropriate individuals or teams. This includes designated communication channels within the organization, as well as external channels when necessary.
Regular Updates:
Continuous updates are provided throughout the incident resolution process. Regular communications inform stakeholders about the progress made, steps taken to address the incident, and any additional measures implemented to prevent recurrence.
Collaboration with Partners:
If the incident involves external parties, Provus collaborates closely with relevant partners, such as Salesforce or other third-party service providers. This ensures a unified and coordinated response, leveraging collective expertise to resolve the incident efficiently.
Customer Communication:
For incidents that may impact customers, Provus is dedicated to transparent communication. Customers are informed promptly about the incident, its potential impact, and the measures being taken to address it. Clear guidance is provided to assist customers in mitigating any associated risks.
Post-Incident Analysis:
Following incident resolution, Provus conducts a thorough post-incident analysis (post mortem). This includes a detailed review of communication procedures to identify opportunities for improvement. Insights gained from this analysis are used to enhance our incident response and communication strategies for the future.
Security Awareness and Training
Employee Training Programs
Ensuring that employees are well informed and trained on security best practices is integral to maintaining a secure environment.
Salesforce Security Training Resources:
Provus leverages Salesforce's security training resources to educate employees on best practices within the Salesforce platform. This includes training modules and resources provided by Salesforce to enhance the security awareness of Provus employees.
Phishing Awareness and Prevention
Given the prevalence of phishing attacks, Provus emphasizes training employees on recognizing and preventing phishing attempts.
Physical Security
Access Controls to Data Centers
While Provus software is housed within the Salesforce platform, considerations for physical security are vital to safeguarding the underlying infrastructure.
Salesforce Data Center Security:
Provus relies on Salesforce's robust physical security measures for the data centers hosting the Salesforce platform. This includes strict access controls, surveillance, and other measures implemented by Salesforce to secure the physical infrastructure. For further information, please refer to
Salesforce’s Platform Security Overview
.
Protection of Endpoints
Endpoint protection is a critical component of Provus's overall security strategy. Provus software, being housed within the Salesforce platform, benefits from the robust endpoint protection measures implemented by Salesforce. Salesforce employs industry-leading practices to secure endpoints, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user access to the platform.
MFA and Secure Login:
Salesforce enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and secure login procedures at the endpoint level, enhancing Provus software security against unauthorized access.
Session Security:
Salesforce implements secure session management practices, safeguarding sessions at the endpoint level. This ensures that user sessions remain uniquely identified, protecting against session hijacking and unauthorized access.
Endpoint Security Best Practices:
Provus aligns its endpoint security practices with Salesforce's recommendations. This includes following best practices for securing devices used to access the Salesforce platform. Measures such as using antivirus software, and firewalls, and keeping operating systems and software up to date are integral to maintaining a secure end-to-end environment.
Collaboration with Customers:
Provus collaborates with customers to bolster endpoint security, providing resources and support for secure practices when accessing Provus software within the Salesforce platform upon request.
Compliance and Auditing
Regular Security Audits
Periodic security audits are conducted to assess compliance with security policies and identify areas for improvement.
Salesforce Compliance Audits:
Provus collaborates with Salesforce to undergo regular security audits. This collaborative effort ensures that Provus's practices align with Salesforce's security standards, providing a comprehensive assessment of compliance within the Salesforce environment.
Compliance with Industry Standards
Adhering to industry-specific security standards is crucial for maintaining compliance and trust.
Salesforce Industry Certifications:
Provus aligns its security practices with industry-specific standards relevant to both services organizations and the Salesforce platform. This includes leveraging Salesforce's industry certifications to demonstrate compliance and adherence to the highest security standards.
Policy Review and Revision
Frequency of Policy Reviews
Regular reviews of security policies are conducted to ensure alignment with evolving technology, regulations, and organizational changes.
Alignment with Salesforce Policies: Provus ensures that its security policies are reviewed in tandem with any updates or changes to Salesforce's security policies. This collaborative approach guarantees that Provus's policies remain aligned with the evolving security landscape within the Salesforce platform.
Process for Updating the Policy
A defined process is in place to propose, review, and approve updates to the Information Security Policy.

Overview
The Provus team is dedicated to providing an optimal user experience for all Provus Service Quoting solution users. To achieve this, Provus's customer experience and product teams work closely with each customer, offering guidance on best practices to enhance the end-to-end opportunity-to-order experience for all users interacting with Provus.
Provus Service Quoting Scalability and Performance Baseline
This section provides details about Provus Services Quoting solution Scalability and Performance baseline.
Salesforce Execution and Governor Limits
Provus is entirely native to the Salesforce Force.com platform, leveraging a blend of platform capabilities such as Apex, SOQL, DML, Visualforce, and Lightning. Consequently, the Provus solution is subject to all Execution Governors and Limits imposed on the Salesforce platform, which may evolve with each Salesforce release.
The link specified provides a quick reference guide for the Execution Governors and Limits:
Salesforce Developer Limits and Allocations Quick Reference
Provus solution uses a combination of the following approaches for transaction processing to provide the optimal user experience for Provus users.
Frontend transaction processing
Apex Server side synchronous operations
Apex Server side asynchronous and batch processing of transactions
Transactions Response times
This section outlines the transaction response time for Provus transactions. However, as Provus Services Quoting is a 100% native Salesforce application, the response times are also impacted by Salesforce infrastructure and related aspects. These factors include:
Resources allocated to sandbox or production orgs.
Caching behavior of Salesforce orgs (the first transaction of the day may take longer).
Provus Services Quoting Transaction
Provus Scalability and Performance Baseline
Provus Services Quote
Scalability Limits
Provides estimation, pricing, and quoting information for one or multiple services.
Estimation includes Scope, Work Breakdown Structure, Effort, Resources, and Schedule.
Pricing includes discounts and markups applied at the overall quote, quote resource item, or resource period level.
A quote item generally represents a unique resource item for a given combination of service and project activity groups (also sometimes referred to as the project methodology phase).
The Time period in the quote schedule represents the weekly, monthly, or quarterly periods in which resource effort is allocated for a given resource item to determine the overall schedule for a project.
The Quote section represents the Service or Activity Group (project methodology phase) within a service.
Quote Resource Items
: A Provus quote can support up to 800 resource line items in a given quote.
Time periods in quote
: A Provus quote can support a maximum of 100 time periods in a given quote schedule.
Resource Time Period Combination in a Quote
: A Provus quote can support up to 10,000 resource item and time period combinations in a given quote.
Services in a Quote:
A
Provus quote can support up to 70 services in a given quote given other related constraints for a quote mentioned in this section. (if 2-level hierarchy is turned off).
A Provus quote can support up to 35 services in a given quote given other related constraints for a quote mentioned in this section (if 2-level hierarchy is turned on).
Quote sections in a Quote
: A Provus Quote can support up to 50 sections within a quote.
WBS Tasks for a Service
: A Provus quote service can support a maximum of 250 tasks per service.
Task Resource Combination for a Service
: A Provus quote service can support a maximum of 1000 task resource combinations per service.
Response Times
In general, most of the quote synchronous transactions and user actions respond within 30 seconds given the above stated scalability limits for a quote.
Pricing
: Provus uses front-end processing for quote pricing, and accordingly most of the price adjustments are completed in less than 5 seconds for a given quote.
WBS and Estimate Changes
: Changes to WBS structure including tasks, resources, effort, and effort allocations impact the overall project, pricing, and quoting. These changes are generally completed within 30 seconds with a processing message such as “Sync in progress. Please wait”.
Async actions
: Clone, Scenario creation, Saving quote as a template, and creating quote from a template are deep cloning functions performed asynchronously and generally completed within 30 seconds.
Provus Estimate Templates
Scalability Limits
Provus Estimate Template provides a reusable template for estimating one or multiple services.
Estimation includes Scope, Work Breakdown Structure, Effort, Resources, and Schedule.
Work Breakdown structure includes Activity Groups, Activities, Tasks, Task resources, and task effort formula definitions.
All the services selected from an Estimate template in a given transaction will create a single Provus Services Quote.
Services in an Estimate Template:
A
Provus Estimate Template can support up to 70 services in a given template while keeping other related constraints for a template mentioned in this section.
WBS Tasks for a Service
: A Provus template service can support a maximum of 250 tasks per service.
Task Resource Combination for a Service
: A Provus quote service can support a maximum of 1000 task resource combinations per service.
Task effort formula
: A Provus template task formula can support up to 32,000 characters in the formula definition.
Response Times
The primary transaction related to the Estimate Template is creating a quote for one or multiple services. Depending on the overall size of the Estimate Template, the quote creation can be synchronous or asynchronous operation. Generally, most quote creation from the Estimate template is completed within 30 seconds (when performed synchronously).
Customer Opportunity / Deal
Scalability Limits
A Customer-facing deal can involve a large number of services from one or multiple business units.
Customer-facing deals can be structured as CRM Opportunity or Provus Quote of Quotes.
Customer-facing
Opportunity/deal
can be linked to one or multiple Provus Service quotes. For example, a given customer deal or opportunity can have separate Provus Service quotes for each service category or business unit.
Services in a customer deal
:
Provus customer deals can support any number of services, within the limitation of a Provus services quote and estimate template.
Provus Services Quotes in deal
: Any number of Provus Services quotes can be linked to a given customer deal.
Response Times
Quote creation for a customer deal
:
The
Provus Guided quote creation wizard can create one or multiple quotes that can get linked to the deal. Using Guided Wizard, quotes are generally created within 30 seconds (If Estimate Template to Estimate Conversion is synchronous).
Provus Document Generation Limits
Provus provides a partner solution for document generation from a Salesforce ISV partner S-Docs.
Document generation limits are governed by S-Doc Limitations as specified below:
S-Docs Limitations – S-Docs for Salesforce (sdocs.com)

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the March 2024 release:
Quote
Ability to Ignore Partial Hours from previous Activity Group while creating schedule - User Defined Calendar
Previously, there were overlapping allocations between activity groups, where the remaining time available to work in the preceding period was subtracted from the full time available to work in the first start period of an activity group if there was timeline overlap.
With this update, the work of each activity group is now started in the period immediately following the last period of the preceding activity group, regardless of any remaining time available to work. This change ensures smoother workflow management and more accurate resource allocation.
Ability to Create a Quote from Quote template (with new linked estimate) for Estimate Based Quote
As a sales user, you can create a new quote from any quote template. This allows you to quickly create new quotes from template quotes.
For estimate-based quotes, when you create a quote from a quote template using the "New Quote from template" action button on the Quote list page or Opportunity page, a new quote is created from the quote template with a new estimate linked to it.
Save quote as a template
:
Create quote from quote template
:
A new quote is created from the quote template. The quote does not share the same estimate as the source quote template. Changes made to the new quote do not impact the source template quote.
Scope - Work Breakdown Structure
Assumptions column is no longer visible on the Work Breakdown Structure subtab under the Scope tab
As a sales user, you will no longer see the
Assumptions
column on the Work Breakdown Structure tab.
However, you can view the
Assumptions
and
Guidance
from the Add/edit Activity Groups/Activities/Tasks dialog.
View Icons instead of Buttons for Add/edit Activity Groups, Activities, Tasks in WBS
As a sales user, you can now view icons instead of buttons for
View/edit Activity Groups
/
Activities
/
Tasks
on the
Work Breakdown Structure
subtab under the
Scope
tab.
If you click View/edit activity groups, you see a dialog to
Add/edit Activity Groups/Activities/Tasks
.
View Resource Summary in Resources Column
As a sales user, you can see the Resource Summary along with resource count in the Resource column. This allows you to view/edit Availability and Split from the Resource column where the capability to view/edit resources exist.
On the Work Breakdown Structure subtab of the Scope Tab, you see a
Resource Summary
(count)
link against Activity Groups in the Resource column, where the count is the number of unique resource roles present in the Activity Group.
If you click on Resource Summary (count), you see the existing Resource Summary dialog, where you can view Resource level effort, Availability, and Split options.
Estimate Template
Ability to Define Resource Availability on Estimate Template
As an estimate template manager, you need the ability to specify resource availability on the estimate template. This allows you to effortlessly generate a quote from the template, incorporating pre-set resource availability, and streamlining the quoting process.
On a Single service or multi-service estimate template, you see a new
Resource Summary
action button on the activity group row level.
If you click the Resource Summary button, a dialog opens which shows the
Resource
role, and a drop down for
Specific Availability
.
Clicking the Specific Availability button, displays the
Availability percentage
of each resource.
If Availability Percentage is Empty, you will see a field level validation error as "
Complete this field
."
If Availability Percentage is less than 1, you will see a field level validation error as "
The Number is too low
."
If you click
Save
, the Resource availability percentage value for the specified resource is saved.
When you create an estimate from the estimate template, you see the Availability Percentage value for a particular resource of a particular activity group as set in the estimate template in the Work breakdown structure and Effort tab of the estimate.
When you create a quote from the above estimate, the quote grid on the Quote summary tab and the Price tab shows the resource allocation as per the Availability Percentage set in the estimate.
The Quote list page shows different estimates for the quote template and the quote created from the quote template.
Support for Decimals on Availability % on Estimate Template
As a sales user, you can now specify availability percentages with decimals on the Estimate Template.
To specify availability percentages, navigate to the Estimate Template and click
Resource Summary
corresponding to the activity group.
If you click the Resource Summary button, a dialog opens which shows the
Resource
role, and a drop down for
Specific Availability
.
If you click
Specify availability
, you can enter the availability percentages with decimals to reflect the exact resource availability.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the April 2024 release:
Quote
View Two Level Section Hierarchy on the Quote Grid
As a user, you can create a quote from an estimate with service and activity group hierarchy. This allows you to create a quote with a two-level hierarchy. This feature is behind the beta feature flag “
Enable: Two Level Hierarchy On Quote Grid
.”
For a single service or multi-service quote from an estimate, when you configure the section, you see two levels of hierarchy (Service Section> Activity Group Section) on the quote grid. You can view the 2-level hierarchy wherever the quote grid is visible i.e. Labor Pricing subtab under the Price tab, and the Resource allocation and Price sections of the Quote summary tab.
Labor Pricing
subtab under the
Price
tab:
Resource allocation
and
Price
sections of the
Quote Summary
tab:
Ability to Edit the Guidance Text for Estimation Input Parameter
As a sales user, you can view and edit the guidance text of estimation parameters so that you can easily manage the guidance text.
When you navigate to the
Estimation Inputs
section on the
Quote Summary
tab or the
Estimation Inputs
subtab of the
Scope
tab, you will see the Estimation Question/Guidance column as a 2-line text area as default.
The Estimation Question/Guidance column is editable.
You can expand the text field to view a larger area by dragging the field from its bottom-right corner.
Clicking
Save
will save any changes made.
Estimation Question/Guidance column in the
Estimation Inputs
section on the
Quote Summary
tab:

Estimation Inputs
subtab of the
Scope
tab:
Ability to Initiate Create Services Quote from External Application
As a user, you can now initiate and create a service quote using the wizard from external systems. This allows you to create a quote from external CRM systems like NetSuite.
Clicking the
Create Services Quote
button from the external CRM initiates the Create Services Quote wizard by redirecting to a Salesforce URL containing parameters.
URL format
: https://<Org_Instance>/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2.
URL
Example
:
https://provus-qa-next.lightning.force.com/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?c__serviceStartDate=2024-03-01&c__Extoppid=MD44
The
Service Start Date
and
External Opportunity Id
parameters and their values are passed in the above URL.
The wizard displays the service start date passed from the external CRM.
When a quote is created from the wizard, the parameter values are stored on the quote fields based on the mapping in settings.
Note:
For each parameter sent from the external CRM, you can create a custom field on the Provus quote with only the following data types:
Text
Date (Format: YYYY:MM:DD)
Picklist
If a parameter value is modified on the UI during the quote field update, the modified value is stored on the quote field.
A parameter is not stored if it is not present in the setting.
The quote field values are retained when a copy of the quote is created in the following scenarios:
Clone
Make Primary
Scenario
Create a Template and Quote from the template
If multiple quotes are created, the same parameter values are stored on all quotes
If quote creation fails and an error is presented on the final screen on the create services quote wizard, the parameters are still available for the next attempt to create a quote (without the need for initiation from external CRM)
An error is generated if a field is not found
An error is generated if a parameter is not found
Automatic Opening of one Quote when Multiple Quotes are created from Quote wizard
When multiple quotes are created from the Create Services Quote wizard, one quote automatically opens. This eliminates the need to manually select or click on the quote to open it. This feature is enabled when the product setting “
Enable Quote Opening From Quote Wizard
” is enabled.
If more than one estimate-based quote is created from the Create Services Quote wizard, one of the quotes is opened automatically. This applies to wizard initiation from the quote list page and the Opportunity.
Example
: In the example below, 2 services are selected, so two quotes will be created.
On the Confirm service selection page of the quote wizard, when you click
Create Quote(s)
,
one quote automatically opens.
Project Schedule
Effective project scheduling considers both the duration and sequence of tasks. This allows you to create service quotes that accurately reflect the project scope, resource needs, and realistic timelines.
There are two primary scheduling approaches:
Top-Down Scheduling
: Ideal for projects with a fixed deadline. You determine the resource requirements needed to meet that deadline.
Bottom-Up Scheduling
: Ideal for projects with a set amount of resources. You estimate a realistic project timeline based on those resource constraints.
Duration
:
Here's how scheduling impacts project duration, illustrated with contrasting approaches:
Bottom-Up Example
: The analysis phase requires an estimated 600 hours of work. This is based on the specific tasks involved, like gathering requirements and creating documentation. The system calculates the total effort based on the complexity and scope of these tasks.
Top-Down Example
: Using the same 600-hour estimate, top-down scheduling focuses on spreading this effort over a specific timeframe, say 4 weeks. The system distributes the 600 hours across those 4 weeks, allocating a set number of hours per week to meet the deadline.
Sequence
:
Project phases can be sequenced in two ways:
Sequential
: Phases must begin only after the previous phase is complete. This applies to tasks with dependencies, like web development, where design finalization precedes development.
Non-Sequential
: Certain phases can be done concurrently, optimizing the overall timeline. This applies to independent tasks, like content creation for a website, which can happen while the design is finalized.
Provus now supports top-down scheduling, providing more flexibility for your project planning.
Ability to Convert Estimate to Quote with Custom Duration
You can see the updated schedule on the quote grid when you create a quote from an estimate or update the project WBS. This allows you to view the correct schedule on the quote.
When you create a quote from an estimate template with the duration details or save the Project WBS tab of the quote/estimate, the quote grid is updated to display resource allocation for the activity groups for Project Duration = Custom.
Project WBS tab
:
Quote Grid
:
For a user-defined calendar, each resource quote item period shows the effort spread equally between the periods.
If the duration is converted from weeks into a different time period, the schedule settings are followed.
If the labor unit is in hours, the allocated hours per period are calculated as Total Effort/Duration (Time periods).
If the labor unit is in headcount, the allocated headcount per period is calculated as Total Effort/[Duration (Time periods) * Available Hours per period].
The section start date and end date are updated accordingly.
Estimate Template
Ability to Add or Edit Activity Groups at the Service level on Estimate Template
As a sales user, you can see the add/edit activity group button inline for each service on the estimate template. This allows you to add/edit activity groups at each service level instead of viewing all services/activity groups. This feature is behind the beta feature flag “
Enable activity group level schedule
.”
Add/edit activity groups
button at the service level on the estimate template:
When you click the Add/edit activities groups button, the Activities Group dialog opens and displays the following details:
The Sequence column is the first column, starting with 1 and incrementing by 1 for each new activity group.
The Create/edit activity groups button and the Service column are no longer visible from the Add/edit activity groups dialog.
The Duration column is visible if the service associated with the activity group has a project duration method set to custom.
Ability to Specify Duration on Activity Groups on Estimate Template
As an admin user, you can specify the duration for an activity group on the estimate template. This allows you to set the top duration assignment.
When you navigate to the Add/edit activity groups dialog, you will see the Duration (Weeks) column added to the right of the Name column. The column is only displayed if the services Project Duration Method is set to Custom.
Add/edit activity groups dialog for service where
Project Duration Method is Custom
:
Add/edit activity groups dialog for service where
Project Duration Method is not Custom
:
Ability to Select and Save Activity Group Duration as Standard Parameter for a Task
As an Estimate Template Admin, you want the ability to define a formula for calculating task duration using 'Duration' as a standard parameter. This allows you to establish a task formula based on the activity group duration in a top-down approach.
When you navigate to the 'Add/edit task parameters -> Estimate duration ->
Define task duration formula
dialog for a task on the estimate template,
You see a search dropdown labeled Activity Group Duration.
The dropdown is visible when the Service's Project Duration Method is set to Custom.
The dropdown displays a list of activity groups within that service.
When you select a parameter from the dropdown,
The chosen parameter is dynamically inserted into the Task duration formula at your current cursor position.
The displayed parameter name appears in the Task duration formula field with the format: <activity group name>.duration.
Estimate
Ability to Edit Activity Group Duration in the Estimate
As an estimate user, you require the duration specified in the estimate template to seamlessly transfer to the estimate during conversion. This foundational duration serves as a reference and enables your estimate to incorporate a default effort when quoting top-down.
When you create an estimate from an estimate template:
Any duration values defined in the activity group templates are automatically transferred to the corresponding activity groups in the new estimate.
When you create a quote using the
Create Services Quote Wizard
:
If an estimate template is used, the duration values are transferred as described above.
When you navigate to the Add/edit activity groups dialog, you will see the Duration (Weeks) column added to the right of the Name column.
The column is only displayed if the services Project Duration Method is set to Custom.
The column allows for whole number inputs only and is required if displayed.
The entered durations are saved and trigger an automatic recalculation of estimation inputs, factoring in the provided durations.
Add/edit activity groups dialog for service where
Project Duration Method is Custom
:
View Quote Currency during Quote Creation from Estimate
As a sales user, you can select a currency different from the rate card currency during quote creation. This allows you to view prices in the quote in the currency of your choice.
For a multi-currency enabled organization:
You can select the quote currency during quote creation from the estimate in the Create Quote dialog.
The selected currency is then stored on the quote.
The Add-On amounts are calculated using the currency conversion ratio and display the currency symbol.
The
Total Quoted Amount
on Adjust Pricing also shows the currency symbol. Changing the currency to the rate card currency adjusts the currency conversion ratio to 1.
For a single-currency organization, only one currency value is shown and defaulted on.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the May 2024 release:
Quote
Ability to Convert Scenario to a Primary Quote
As a sales user, you can create a quote from a scenario so that you can manage a quote independent of the source scenario. This functionality is behind the beta flag -
Convert Scenario into Quote
.
When you select a scenario and click
Make Primary
:
You see a confirmation message “This action will designate the selected scenario as a quote and convert the current quote into a scenario. Are you sure you want to proceed?”
If you confirm, the type of the selected
Scenario
is changed to a
Quote
.
You will now see the “Primary” label on each quote (Quote Type=Quote) and not on any scenario.
The quote is displayed as the leftmost card, with cards for the existing scenario (if any), the quote converted to a scenario, and the scenario converted to a quote shown side-by-side.
Ability to Change the Service Start Date for a Single Service Quote
As a Provus user, you can see the Select
Services
tab for single service quotes so that you can manage the start dates of service. This feature is behind the beta feature flag -
Enable: Service Start Date Change
.”
You can change the Service
Start Date
and save.
The changed date is reflected in the Quote header.
View Default Quote Description for New Quote From Template
As a sales user, you can select a template before selecting a description on the New Quote From Template dialog. This allows you to view or edit the description for the new quote. This functionality is available behind the beta feature flag - “
Release: Select Quote Template Before Description
.”
In the Create Quote from Template dialog, the fields are shown in the following sequence:
Template
Description
Estimate Template
Ability to Auto-Populate the Preferred Resources on Estimate Template
As an estimation manager, you can view the auto-populated preferred resources on the estimate template so you can define the resource mix.
When the estimate template has tasks with single or multiple resources assigned AND attributes (like Location, Skill, etc., as defined in the attribute group:
When you click the
Preferred Resources
button on the estimate template header, you see the list of the unique resource roles assigned to all the tasks in the “Select preferred resources” pop-up.
You can set the row values and save.
When you create an estimate/quote from the estimate template where the preferred resources are set:
The rate card item corresponding to the resource role and the rate card attributes are considered for pricing.
If the preferred resource is not set for a resource role on the estimate template, the estimate/quote considers any rate card item matching the criteria.
You see the rate card item attribute values on the Resources Mix card/tab of the quote.
Manage Add-Ons
Ability to Mass Add Add-On Items
As a sales user, you can select multiple add-ons and add those in bulk. This functionality is available behind the beta flag - “
Release: Mass add add-ons
.”
You will see a new
Add Add-Ons
button on the Add-Ons grid (Add-Ons tab and Add-Ons section of the Quote summary).

section on the
Quote Summary

subtab under the
Price

When you click the Add add-ons button, the
Add add-ons
dialog opens. The Add add-ons dialog displays the list of all add-ons along with the
Add-Ons Category
(Product Family of the Add-Ons).
You can select one or more add-ons using the checkboxes. After selection or de-selection, the text "Select add-ons to be included in the quote (<count> selected)" is updated with the count of the add-ons selected.
When you save, the selected add-ons are added to the add-ons grid. The Provus admin can hide the button based on the persona using the custom permission
Quote Tab: Mass Add Add-ons
. Additionally, the ability to add add-ons inline is removed.
Usability Improvements
Ability to Expand/Collapse Service row on Quote Grid
As a sales user, you can view a two-level hierarchy on the quote grid and can expand/collapse service rows so that you can see both the Service Name and Section (Activity Group) names on the quote grid. This feature is behind the beta feature flag -
“Expand Collapse Service on Quote Grid
.”
By default, all the Service rows are expanded.
You can see all activity Group rows and quote items when the Service is expanded.
You can see only Service rows when the Service is collapsed.
If you expand/collapse on a quote grid, the other quote grids are not impacted.

Release Process

Type of Release

Quote
Synchronization of Primary Quote to Opportunity
As a sales user, you can now see Opportunity product line items and quotes updated when you create/modify a quote. This ensures that quotes and services are correctly reflected on the opportunity. This functionality is behind the beta flag -
”Convert Scenario into Quote.”
Only quotes with label = Primary are shown on the Opportunity.
Suppose you have a quote linked to an Opportunity as shown below:
You create a scenario from the quote:
When you mark a scenario as a quote (Make primary),
The Quotes on the linked Opportunity show the new quote with the primary label (Quote with Record type = Quote)
Opportunity products line items show the product line items' new quote with the primary label (Quote with Record type = Quote).
Ability to Edit Start Date Offset for an Activity Group on Quote/Estimate
As a Provus user, you can specify a
Start Date Offset
for an activity group on the estimate/quote. This allows you to set dependencies between activity groups. This feature is behind the beta feature flag -
Enable activity group level schedule
.
When you click the
View/edit activity groups
icon for a service on the estimate, you will see a dialog with a new column
Start Date Offset (Weeks)
as shown below:
The Start Date Offset (Weeks) is an Editable Whole Number Optional field. By default, this field shows the value from the estimate template. If left empty, the value is considered as 0.
You can set the value as a positive whole number. If you enter a decimal or a negative value is entered, you will see a field-level error message as "Not a valid increment".
When you click save, the Start Date Offset (Weeks) is saved for the Activity Group, and the Activity Group Start Date and Activity Group End Date are calculated and saved according to the following logic:
Activity Group Start Date = Service Start Date + Start Date Offset (Weeks)
Activity Group End Date = Activity Group Start Date + Calculated Duration of the Activity Group
Ability to Hide Estimation Inputs and Select Services on the Quote Summary
As an admin, you can hide estimation inputs and select services cards from the quote summary tab based on specific user personas. This ensures that certain teams do not see these items on the quote summary if they don't need to.
The admin can hide the following cards using separate custom permissions:
Estimation inputs -
PSQ.Quote Summary Tab: Estimation Inputs Card
Select services -
PSQ.Quote Summary Tab: Select Services Card
The admin can hide these cards without hiding the sub-tabs.
Quote Summary tab before hiding the Estimation Inputs and Select Services cards
:
Quote Summary tab after hiding the Estimation Inputs and Select Services cards:
Hierarchical View of Services/Activity Groups in Estimation Inputs Side Panel
Provus users can now
easily filter and select the estimation inputs parameters so that they can
update the estimation parameters quickly.
This feature is behind the beta feature flag
- “
Estimation Inputs new view
.
”
When you are on the Estimation Inputs section of the quote summary OR Estimation Inputs subtab of the Scope tab on the quote, you can see a new component with two panels.
The left panel displays a list of 3 sections which act as filters to the list of records:
All
Global
Services - Shows the 2-level hierarchy as below:
<Service 1>
Service Level Parameters
<Activity Group 1.1>
<Activity Group 1.2>
<Service 2>
Service Level Parameters
<Activity Group 2.1>
<Activity Group 2.2>
You can view only the services selected in the quote and rename the labels All, Global, and Services using custom labels or translation workbench.
The right panel displays vertical and horizontal scroll bars if the list does not fit into the panel.
You will get a confirmation message if you enter an estimation input value for a service and navigate to another service on the left pane.
The global section on the left is hidden if no global parameter exists. Tooltips for all the service parameters will be visible in the left pane.
Primary Scenario - Mark the newly created Scenario as 'Draft'
As a sales user, you can create a scenario in draft status instead of active. So that when you mark it as primary, you do not see the primary quote as active. This is behind the beta flag - “
Convert Scenario into Quote
.”
You can create a scenario from a quote or another scenario. The status of the newly created scenario is '
Draft
'.
Ability to see a Progress Bar during Quote Creation
As a Provus user, you can see the progress bar of the quote creation process to know approximately how long the quote creation will take.
This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Show Progress Bar for Quote Creation
.”
For an estimate quote, when you click the
Create Services Quote(s)
button in the quote wizard (from the opportunity or quote list page), you can see the progress bar of the quote creation process until the quote is created.
Estimate Template
Ability to Delete Custom Activity Group/Activity (No Child Entities)
As a sales user, you can delete a custom activity group or activity. This allows you to remove any unwanted groups or activities. This functionality is behind the beta flag -"
Release: Delete Custom Activity Group/Activity
.”
You can delete the custom activity group or activity only if there is no child entity. The trash icon on the View/Edit Activity Groups/Activities dialog is disabled if the Activity Group or the Activity has at least one child entity.
On the
View/Edit Activity
Groups
dialog, you will see a tooltip: "Deleting requires removal of all activities."
On the
View/Edit Activities
dialog, you will see a tooltip: "Deleting requires removal of all tasks."
You can delete the task/activity/activity group, even if it is the only task/activity/activity group.
Usability Improvements
Ability to Edit Long Text for Formula Field
As an estimate template manager, you can enter formulas longer than 255 characters in the formula builder to view and add longer formulas to meet business requirements. This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Long text field for formula builder
.”
On the Define task duration formula page, you can enter and save formulas in the long text area which supports up to 32K characters.
You can expand the field by dragging the lower right corner.
You can clear the entered formula using the
Clear
option.
The text automatically moves to the new line if the formula is longer than the width of the field.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the July 2024 release:
Quote
View Quote Details as Read-Only for Estimate Quote
As a read-only Provus licensed user, you can open an estimate quote in read-only mode. This allows you to view the quote's details without the ability to edit it. This feature is behind the beta flag "
Read-only quote
."
As a read-only user, you can toggle between "View Additional Details" and "Back" on the quote page. The "Details" tab is shown in read-only mode. These features apply to all quote types and estimates linked to quotes.
Note: The Salesforce standard highlight panel is NOT read-only, meaning the PS team can add custom actions.
Convert Quote from Estimate with Start Date Offset Details
As a user, you can create a quote from an estimate with schedule details specified for an activity group.
You can select the Timeline Segment by navigating to
Estimate Template
>
Related > Activity Groups
>
Activity Group Template Name
>
Details
.
This enables you to create a quote with the activity groups' dependencies. When you create an estimate/quote with the Start Date Offset (Weeks) details of activity groups, the Quote grid shows the service and activity groups quote sections as below:
If Start Date Reference = Predecessor End Date
Activity group Start Date = Previous activity group in sequence + Start Date Offset (weeks).
If Start Date Reference = Service Start Date:
The activity group starts at the Service Start Date.
Start Date Offset (weeks) supports positive and negative integer values. This feature works for both User-defined and Weekday Calendar and all time periods.
Ability to Make Estimation Guidance Read-Only
As a Provus admin, you can show the estimation guidance/assumption column as read-only so that you can enforce estimation guidance/assumption from the estimate template.
View Effort Adjustment, Adjustment Reason, and Calculated Effort on WBS
As a Provus user, you can add an adjustment reason on the WBS tab so that the Effort tab can be hidden for customers. This is behind a beta flag Release: Adjustment Reason on WBS.
On the WBS tab, you see the following columns with the same behavior as present in the Effort tab:
Effort Adjustment - Read-only field
Calculated Effort
Adjustment Reason
If you adjust the effort and/or provide an adjustment reason on the Effort tab, the same is reflected on WBS when you
Save
and sync to the quote.
If you adjust the effort and/or provide an adjustment reason on the WBS tab, the same is reflected on Effort when you
Save
and sync to the quote.
Ability to Delete/Remove Section from Direct Quote
As a sales user, you can remove a section from the direct section quote so that you can modify the quote as per your needs. This feature is behind a beta feature flag “
Release: Remove Empty Section on Quote Grid
.”
When you right-click on the section row, you will see the"Remove Section" option on the Resource Allocation card in the Quote Summary and Price tab.
Resource Allocation card on Quote Summary
:
Price tab
:
The “Remove section” option is only visible when there are no resources inside the section.
The option is not visible for the first section.
When you select the option, the section row is removed from the quote grid and summary tables.
Ability to Change the Service Start Date on Quote/Scenario for Direct Quotes
As a Provus user, you can change the service start date on a direct quote/scenario to meet business needs. This functionality is behind the beta flag - "Change Service Start Date on Direct Quote."
On the Scenario card and quote header, you will see an edit icon:
The edit icon is hidden if the scenario card is not selected.
When you click on the edit icon, you will see the Edit Quote/Edit Scenario dialog with the following fields:
Quote Name:
read-only
Description:
editable
Service Start Date:
editable
If you can change the Service Start Date and Save.
The following updates occur:
Sections (applies to Section quote only), Resource Quote Items, and Add-Ons Quote Items:
Updates Start Date and End Date, keeping the time periods the same.
Updates Service End Date on the quote, keeping the duration/time periods the same.
The quote grid and add-ons grid show updated allocations according to the new Service Start Date and new Service End Date.
If you change the Description and Save, the quote description is updated
If the rate card is not active on the Service Start Date (either marked as Active = No or the entered service start date is outside the effective date and expiration date of the rate card), an inline error message appears: "The Rate Card is expired/inactive during the selected service start date."
If you are on the Additional Details tabs, the view automatically switches to the main Provus tabs so that pricing is updated.
Updated prices for the time period groups and the total amount are displayed.
The edit icon on the Scenario card and Quote header is hidden for read-only users.
Estimate Template
Ability to Set Default Values for Estimation Input Parameters
As an admin, you can set the default values for Number and Checkbox data type estimation parameters so that you can have the default estimation input values for the quote created from the estimate template.
This is behind the beta feature flag “
Enable: Default Values For Scope Parameters
.”
When you navigate to the
Define estimation parameters
dialog of the estimate template,
You can see the
Add Values
icon next to the scope parameter.
When you click the Add Values icon, the
Define default value
dialog opens.
Number Data Type:
Checkbox Data Type:
You can enter the default value in the input field and click
Save
. On saving, the default value is saved for the scope parameter.
View the Default Values of Estimation Input Parameters on Estimate/Quote
As a sales user, you can see the default values of estimation parameters set in the estimate template so that you don't need to fill in the parameters manually. This is behind the beta feature flag - "
Enable estimation inputs default values
."
When you create an estimate/quote from the estimate template where the default values are set, you see the default values set in the estimate template are copied into the ‘Value’ field in the following places:
Estimation Inputs card of the Quote summary tab
Estimation Inputs subtab under the Scope tab of the quote
Suppose you set a value “44” for a scope parameter on the estimate template:
Estimation Inputs card on the Quote summary tab
:
Estimation Inputs subtab under the Scope tab of the quote
:
The
task effort calculation using a formula incorporates the default values set for each parameter.
Pricing
Ability to Override Base Cost for Add-Ons
As a sales user, you can override/adjust the add-on cost on the quote item so that you can adjust the add-on cost as per customer needs. This is behind the beta flag: “
Enable: Add-On Cost Override
.”
You will see a new Base Cost (USD) field on the add-ons grid.
A new field on the quote item called Rate Card Unit Cost stores the initial calculated Unit Cost value derived from the rate card.
By default, the Base Cost column shows the Rate Card Unit Cost from the quote item. You can edit the Base Cost cell of a quote item. You will see the Total Cost recalculated when you edit the Base Cost.
If the overridden value is 0, negative, or any other non-numeric character, then the value is not stored, and the cell displays the original base cost value.
If the Base Cost is not equal to the Rate Card Unit Cost, the cell color changes.
If you delete the overridden cell value, the cell value returns to the Rate Card Unit Cost from the rate card.
You can also modify the overridden cell value to a new value.
This feature applies to all quotes, whether the quote has a linked estimate or not.
If the Rate Card Base Cost is changed (due to rate card changes), then the overridden Base Cost value is not changed.
The admin can hide/show the Base Cost column based on the existing metadata configuration. This applies to the add-on tab and the add-on card on the Quote Summary.
Effort
Ability to Mass Update Effort
As a Provus user, you can mass update the recurring hours of the resources in a quote so that you don't need to manually update the resource allocation. This feature is behind the feature flag “
Enable: Mass update resources effort
.”
When you are on the quote grid (Resource allocation card or Price tab) for direct quotes (with or without sections), you will see a new button labeled
Mass effort update
.
When you click the Mass effort update button, a wizard step 1 page
Select resources to update
appears.
The Select resources to update page displays all read-only columns like the
Sequence number of the record
,
Role, and Attribute group fields
- e.g., Location Display Name, Skill, Band, etc. (Attribute group fields are dynamically shown for a quote based on the attribute group on the estimate template), and
Section
(For quotes without sections, this field is hidden.) You will see the label "Selected <count>", where <count> is the number of records selected and a search box to search for a resource.
When you click
Next
on the step 1 of the Mass Effort Update wizard, the Specify effort from selected resources page appears. (step 2 of the wizard.)
On step 2 of the Mass Effort Update wizard, you will see the following details:
Search box
- You can search with multiple words. It filters the rows matching the search word in any column of the table.
Label
- "Selected <count>" where <count> is the number of records selected in the resources table.
The selected resource records (from step 1) with read-only fields like Sequence number of the record,
Role
, and
Attribute group
fields - e.g., Location Display Name, Skill, Band, etc. Attribute group fields are dynamically shown for a quote based on the attribute group on the rate card, Section (For quotes without sections, this field is hidden.),
You will also see the following editable fields:
Total <Labor Units> per <Time period> - e.g., Total Hours per Week.
If you enter a negative value or characters, it shows a field-level error: “The number is too low.”
No of <Time Period> - e.g., No of Weeks.
If you enter a negative value or characters, it shows a field-level error: “The number is too low.”
Starting <Time Period> - e.g., Starting week. This is a picklist field with the default set as the first period. The field displays the list of time periods added in the quote (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, etc.). It also displays an error message when No of <Time Period> + Starting <Time Period> exceeds the limit of 468 periods.
If you go to the previous step and come back, the existing values of Total <Labor Units> per <Time period>, No of <Time Period>, and Starting <Time Period> are retained.

Ability to add Effort Adjustment, Adjustment Reason, Calculated Effort on WBS
As a Provus user, you can add an adjustment reason on the WBS tab so that the Effort tab can be hidden for customers. This functionality is behind the beta flag - "
Release: Adjustment Reason on WBS

Effort Adjustment:
read-only

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the September 2024 release:
Quote
Create a Duplicate Section for Direct Quote
As a Provus user, you can add a duplicate section for the direct quotes so that you can quickly create a resource item in the quote grid.
This feature is behind the beta flag - “
Release: Direct Quote - Duplicate a Section.
”
When you right-click on a section in a direct quote within the Resource Allocation card or the Price tab, you will see a new menu action named "Duplicate section."
Upon clicking the "Duplicate section” option, a dialog "Duplicate section" appears. Enter the name of the new section and click the
Duplicate section
button.
A new section with the name you provided is created, containing the same resource quote items as the original section.
The entire quote item information, including quote item discount, price/cost override, resource name (including renamed resource), and resource allocation, is copied into the new section.
The newly added section gets added after the current section in the Resource Allocation card, Price card, and Price tab.
The sequence number of the new section is incremented by 1 compared to the current section.
The sequence number of all subsequent sections is adjusted so that there is an increment of 1.
Once a section is added, repricing is done to update the total amount/cost considering contingency, COLA, and any applied discounts.
Note: If you duplicate a section with quote item custom fields, the custom field values are not copied.
View and Edit Custom Fields for Quote items on the Quote Grid
As a Provus user, you want the ability to view and update custom resource fields so that you can capture the resource details as you need.
This feature is behind the feature flag - “
Enable: custom fields for quote resources
.”
When you are on the quote grid, you can see the custom fields (added to Quote Item) as columns on the quote grid based on the quote configurator component, Quote configurator card, and Resource allocation card component settings.
On the Quote grid, you can edit the fields, and the field value is saved when you select or enter the value. Default values are set from the object manager field definition.
The admin can set the field as visible/hidden, read-only, default, and sequence based on the component settings. Custom fields are displayed after the “Total Person Hours” field.
For custom field configuration on the quote grid, refer to -
Configure Custom Fields
.
View the 'Create Quote from Quote Template' flow on Create Quote Wizard
As a Platform user/Sales user, you can create a quote from a quote template using the
Create Services Quote wizard
, enabling you to create a service quote from one place. This feature is available behind the beta feature flag - “
Release: Quote from Template in Create Quote Wizard
.”
As a Sales User, when you click on the "
Create Services Quote
" button on the Opportunity or on the Quote list page, on Step 1 "Select Quote Type," you will see an additional radio button on Step 1 of the wizard: "Quote from Quote Template".
The Provus admin can hide any of the radio button options, set the default radio button options, and rename the labels of the radio buttons via component settings.
If all options are hidden, the wizard will skip this step and move directly to the next step, using the default option configured for the subsequent flow.
If the admin defaults the "Quote from Quote Template" in quote types metadata and removes all other types from metadata, you will not see the first step of the Create Services Quote wizard and will be taken directly to step 2.
In step 2, you will see the "Create Quote" action. When you click on "Create Quote":
If the rate card is not active (either marked as ‘inactive’ or it is ‘active’ but the Service Start Date does not fall within the Effective and Expiration dates on the rate card), an error message will appear, and the dialog will remain open.
As a Platform user, you can initiate the Create Services Quote wizard from an external system using a URL.
You can pass URL parameters, and the parameter values received in the URL will override the field values.
Fields will be defaulted with values from the parameters if the field is present in step 2 of the wizard. In case a field is not found, the error will be logged in the console.
When the quote is created using the Create Services Quote wizard, the parameter values are stored on the quote fields based on the mapping present in the settings. If the parameter value is modified in the UI during the quote field update on the Create Services Quote wizard, the modified value will be stored in the quote field. If a parameter is not present in the settings, it will not be stored.
The quote field values are retained when a copy of the quote is created in the following scenarios:
Clone
Scenario
Create Template and Quote from Template
If quote creation fails and an error is presented on the final screen of the Create Services Quote wizard, the parameters are still available for the next attempt to create the quote, without the need to initiate it again from the external CRM.
For Create Quote from Quote Template configuration, refer to -
Configure Default Quote Type
.
To create quotes from External CRM, refer to -
Salesforce CRM Integration
.

As a Provus Quoting user, when you access a Quote in Pending Approval/Approved/Rejected Status, you cannot edit the quote or take any actions on it. This functionality is behind the beta flag - “

.”
When you access a Direct Quote with a status of Approved/Rejected (based on a configurable expression), the following Quote Grid actions will be unavailable:

Pricing
Apply Quote-Level Discounts Using Absolute Discount Values
As a Quote Manager
, you can enter a discount amount at the Quote Level to  provide an evenly rounded quote amount to a customer. This feature is controlled by the beta feature flag - “
Enable Quote Level Discount Amount
.”
When you are on the
Quote Level Discount
section of the
Adjust Pricing
dialog within a quote, you will see a new editable
Allocated Disc Amt
field:
This field allows decimal input up to 5 places.
If  you  enter/edit Allocated Disc Amt:
Allocated Disc %  displays the calculated value as:  (Allocated Disc Amt)/Total Amount)*100 up to 5 decimal places.
If  you enter/edit the Allocated Disc % value
Allocated Disc Amt is calculated as:  ( Allocated Disc %*Total Amount )/100
Total Quoted Amt  on Adjust Pricing dialog header is recalculated as Total Quoted Amt = Total Quote Amt - Allocated Disc Amt
On Apply
: The discount value and quote pricing are saved, and it will be considered a
Total Quoted Amount override
.
Apply Tiered or Volume Discounts for Time Period/Time Period Group Aggregation Type
As a Provus user, you can apply volume or tiered-based discounts using the quote-level aggregation type so that you can perform discounting according to your needs. The tiered discount feature is controlled by the product feature flag “
Enable Tiered Discount
” in the Pricing Settings of Custom Metadata.
When
Enable Tiered Discount
and
Enable Volume Discount
from the Pricing Settings custom metadata is set as On:
If you navigate to the  Adjust pricing dialog of the quote and apply the volume discount, and if there are any existing discounts of a different type, you will see a message “This will remove the already applied discounts, are you sure you want to continue?”
If you confirm, then the existing discounts are removed and the new discount is applied as follows:
If Aggregation Metric =  Labor Revenue, the weighted average discount % is calculated to 5 decimals based on the Labor Revenue for each
Time Period
or
Time Period Group
and applied to all the line items.
If Aggregation Metric = Person (Labor Unit), the weighted average discount % is calculated to 5 decimals based on the Labor unit for each
Time Period
or
Time Period Group
and applied to all the line items.
You can view the calculated discount amount in the quote line item price breakdown in the Vol Discount field and the Quote pricing is recalculated.

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the October 2024 release:
Quote
Increased Height of Quote Grid Components
As a Provus user, you can see an increase in the height of the quote grid components, providing you with more space to work on the quote grid. This feature is available behind the beta feature flag -
Enable: Increase height of the quote grid components
.
Provus Admin can configure the height of the component by setting the number of rows, including the total rows and sections for Resource Allocation and Labor Pricing cards/tabs.
The configuration is done within the existing metadata settings for the tabs/cards.
The grid scroll appears when the number of rows exceeds the height of the component.
Totals are displayed at the end of the rows.
If the number of rows is fewer than the component height, the component will automatically adjust.
This functionality applies to both estimate-based quotes and staffing quotes.
For information about configuring the quote grid component dimensions, refer to:
Configure Quote Grid Dimensions
Warning for Users Attempting to Remove Sections with Child Resources
As a Platform Sales User, when you attempt to remove an empty default section or a section that contains resources, you will get a warning message. The feature is behind an existing beta feature flag: “
Release: Remove Empty Section on Quote Grid
.”
For a direct section quote, you will see the "Remove section" option by right-clicking a section row, including the Default section.
When you click "Remove section",
If the section is not empty, you will see an error message: "Unable to remove section. Please remove all child resources before deleting the section."
If the section is a default section, you will see an error message: "Default section cannot be removed."
Ability to Select Rate Card during Quote creation for Estimate Quote
As a Sales user, you can select a rate card in the
Create Quote
Wizard
so that you can use the resource prices from the selected rate card on the quote. This functionality is behind the beta feature flag - “
Allow Rate Card selection on Create Quote
.” This feature enables support for selecting a rate card during the creation of an estimate-based quote.
Create Services Quote Wizard: Step 2 (Create new quote)
You will see an optional, editable
Search
combo box for the
Rate Card
field.
The field is blank by default.
The
Search
combo box displays a list of active and non-expired rate cards. You can search and select a value from this list.
If an
Account
is specified:
You will see rate cards specific to the specified account.
Global rate cards
(not tied to a specific account) are also available.
If the
Service Start Date
and/or
Account
is changed such that the selected rate card becomes invalid:
The
Rate Card field
will be
cleared
.
A disappearing message appears for 3 seconds: "
Rate Card is cleared since it is not valid according to the selected Service Start Date and/or Account
."
If the selected rate card does not have an active estimate template linked:
An
inline error message
appears when you try to proceed to the next step: "
Rate Card selected does not have an active Estimate Template linked. Select another Rate Card.
"
The Provus admin
can also show/hide, set a default, or make the
Rate Card field
read-only based on custom metadata settings.
Create Services Quote Wizard: Step 3 (Select Services to be included in the quote)
You will see the list of services from the estimate templates associated with the selected rate card.
Services are organized into
Service Categories
corresponding to the services in the estimate templates.
Ability to Revert to the Original Resource Role
As a Sales user, you can revert to the original resource name, so that you can see the resource as it was when it was first added. This capability is behind the beta feature flag - “
Revert the resource/add-on name to original.
”
For a direct quote, click "
Rename role
.”
The
Rename resource role
dialog opens.
The Rename resource role dialog has the following fields:
Default
: Displays the default/original resource role.
Alias
: Displays the current alias/overridden resource role name.
Reset to Default
: This button is enabled only if the Alias name differs from the Default resource name (case-sensitive comparison).
If the Alias name is the same as the Default resource name (case-sensitive comparison), you will see the Default resource name in the quote grid without any brackets.
Ability to Revert to the Original Add-On Name
As a Sales user, you can revert to the original add-on name, so that you can see the add-on as it was when it was first added. This capability is behind the beta feature flag - “
Revert the resource/add-on name to original.
”
For an estimate based and a direct quote, click "
Rename add-on
.”
The
Rename add-on
dialog opens.
The Rename add-on dialog has the following fields:
Default
: Displays the default/original add-on name.
Alias
: Displays the current alias/overridden add-on name.
Reset to Default
: This button is enabled only if the Alias name differs from the Default add-on name (case-sensitive comparison).
If the Alias name is the same as the Default add-on name (case-sensitive comparison), you will see the Default add-on name in the quote grid without any brackets.
Automatically show/hide Provus actions according to the updated Quote status
Provus actions are controlled by Page Action custom metadata. Each Page Action record has a visibility filter that drives when the action is shown on the Quote page for a given type of quote. For example, If ‘Make Primary’ action needs to be hidden for the Quote status = ‘Rejected’, the visibility filter will contain PSQ__Status__!=Rejected.
If the quote status is updated via the standard Salesforce approval process, the Provus actions are now shown/hidden according to the updated status, without the need of a refresh. For example, the ‘Make Primary’ action is visible when the Quote is in ‘Pending Approval’ and then the approver rejects the Quote because it is not within the organization’s margin guidelines. The Quote status changes to the ‘Rejected’ status and the user can see the Quote status = ‘Rejected’ with ‘Make Primary’ hidden, without the need for refresh.
View Estimate Based Quote in Read-Only mode, based on Quote status
When an estimate based Quote has been submitted for approval or is approved/rejected, it is not recommended that you update the Quote. Provus now shows the estimate based Quote in read-only mode, for the specific Quote statuses, based on configuration.
For admin Configuration, refer to:
Configure Estimate Based Quotes
View Staffing (Direct) Quote in Read-Only mode, based on Quote status
When a staffing Quote has been submitted for approval or is approved/rejected, it is not recommended that the users update the Quote. Provus now shows the staffing Quote in read-only mode, for the specific Quote statuses, based on configuration.
For admin configuration, refer to:
Configure Staffing (Direct) Quotes
Estimate Template
Ability to Save Additional Rate Cards on Estimate Template
As an Estimate Template Manager, you can select secondary rate cards for your estimate template, allowing the template to support multiple rate cards. This feature is behind the beta flag - “
Enable: Multi-Rate Card Estimate Templates
.”
On the Estimate Template, you see a new button labeled "Add/remove secondary rate cards".
When you click the Add/remove secondary rate cards button, the
Add/remove secondary rate cards
dialog opens.
The Secondary Rate Card is an editable search combo-box field.
You can search and select any active rate cards configured in the org, except the below:
Rate Card(Primary) of the estimate template.
Secondary rate cards already added to the list.
After you select the rate card and click
Save
, the system performs the following validations:
If all the roles in the secondary rate card are present in the Primary Rate Card.
If validation fails, an error message is displayed:
"Resource roles in this rate card do not match with those in the rate card: '{0}'"
, where "{0}" is the Primary Rate Card on the Estimate Template.
If all the attribute group fields (including custom attributes) of the selected rate card match the attribute group of the Primary Rate Card.
If validation fails, an error message is displayed:
"Attributes from the Attribute Group of the rate card do not match with those from the rate card: '{0}'"
, where "{0}" is the Primary Rate Card on the Estimate Template.
The secondary rate cards are saved to the estimate template if all validations pass.
Ability to Save Preferred Resources for Secondary Rate Cards on Estimate Template
As an Estimate Template Manager, you can set the preferred resources for secondary rate cards on your estimate template, so that the estimate template supports multiple rate cards. This is behind the beta flag - “
Enable: Multi-Rate Card Estimate Templates
.”
When you click the
Preferred Resources
button on the estimate template header, you will see a dialog with the following details:
The left navigation panel displays a list of rate cards. The Primary Rate Card is shown at the top of the list. Secondary Rate Cards are shown in the sequence in which they were added to the estimate template.
When you select any rate card from the left panel:
You will see the rate card item attributes for the resource roles added to the tasks in the estimate template.
You will see the Account and Currency sub-titles.
For the Primary Rate Card, the system, by default, sets the rate card item attributes, which you can modify if needed.
For Secondary Rate Cards, you can set or modify the rate card item attributes. The Secondary Rate Cards also get the default value of rate card item attributes.
You can search for resource roles using the search box.
On Save, the preferred resource rate card items are saved on the estimate template.
If you have made changes but haven’t saved them yet, a confirmation message will appear: "Y
ou have unsaved changes. Do you want to save?
"
Pricing
Apply location based Markups (along with discounts)
You can apply a negative discount based on location using the ‘Labor Disc - By Location’ option in Adjust Pricing.
Quote without Negative Discount
:
Quote with Location-wise Negative Discount applied
:
All the previously applied discounts are removed.
The location discount will be applied to all line items where the resources are located.
Apply Section based Markups (along with discounts)
You can apply a section-based negative discount  using the ‘Labor Disc by Resource Attributes’ option in Adjust Pricing.
Quote without Negative Discount
:
Quote with Section-wise Negative Discount applied
:
Volume Discount Supports Precision Up to Two Decimal Places
As a Provus user, you can now apply volume discounts with precision up to two decimal places.
When you select the Labor Discount - By Volume Discount via the Adjust Pricing button, you can now enter discount values with precision up to two decimal places. For example, 10.22%. The discount is applied to the quote.
If you enter a discount value with more than two decimal places, an error message will appear notifying you of the invalid input.
Usability Enhancements
Auto-Refresh add-ons when Pricing Summary is Updated
As a Provus user, you can view the add-ons grid in sync with the pricing summary, so that you see the same time periods as displayed in the pricing summary.
If you add periods to the quote grid, either from Resource Allocation, the add-ons widget on the Quote Summary and the add-ons tab will be automatically updated to reflect the same periods as on the quote grid.
When you modify the add-on items by either adding, removing, or making them non-billable, the changes are automatically reflected across all tabs where the add-on component exists, ensuring consistency across the platform.
Enhanced Date Validation on Milestone Creation (Invalid Date Format Handling)
As a Platform Sales User, you can see the correct date format in the error message so that you are aware of the required date format.
This feature is behind the beta flag - "
Validate date format in Milestones for Estimated Date
."
In the "Milestones of alignment Occurs on a Date" scenario, during step 2, "Create new Milestone aligned to Date," when you click "Next," you will see an error message.
The date format is based on the user locale and the date format per locale is based on:

New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the June 2025 release:
Functional Enhancements
View Service-Wise Price Summary on Quote
As a sales manager, you can now view a summary of services within the Summary tab of the estimate quote. This enhancement allows you to analyze quote pricing broken down by service. This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Two Level Hierarchy On Quote Grid
”.
On the Summary tab,  a new Service Summary table is displayed below the existing Section Summary table.
The Service Summary has the same fields as the Section Summary, but aggregates data based on each service.
Service (all services from the quote grid)
Person <Units>
% of Total Head Count
Quoted Amount
% of Total Quoted Amount
Total Cost
% of Total Cost
Margin
Note: The Cost and Margin fields are hidden for users with the Sales role.
The service summary automatically updates when you add or remove services.
If you remove or add all activity groups for a service, this is reflected in the summary.
The service summary is not shown for Direct Quotes or when the Two-Level Hierarchy is disabled.
The service summary is copied on Scenario, Cloned Quote, Quote Template, and Quote from Template.
The admin can configure the visibility of the service summary through a custom metadata setting.
For configuration information, refer to -
Hide Service Summary on Summary Tab
Tiered Pricing Support for Rate Card Items
Businesses often need pricing models that adapt to varying conditions such as quantity, duration, or usage levels. Tiered pricing allows you to define rate card items with multiple tiers based on specific criteria.
For example, you can set different prices depending on the quantity purchased—larger quantities may qualify for lower rates. When the criteria match a defined tier, the corresponding price is automatically applied.
This feature supports more flexible, scalable, and accurate pricing strategies, helping businesses tailor pricing to different customer scenarios and drive better outcomes.
As a Provus Admin, you can configure tiered pricing for rate card items so that pricing can dynamically adjust based on value ranges and attribute-driven conditions.
You can add tier-based pricing to a rate card item in the Rate Card.
Step 1
In a Rate Card Item related tab, when you click the
New
button, you can add a Match Criteria to the rate card item.
Match Criteria
:
All conditions – Acts as an AND operator. All conditions must be met before selecting the price tier.
Any condition – Acts as an OR operator. Based on Evaluation Priority, the system checks if at least one condition matches.
Evaluation Priority – Defines the order in which Pricing Tier Conditions are evaluated. Lower numbers have higher priority.
Note:
If a condition in the evaluation order is inactive, the system should skip it and check the next condition in the sequence.
Price Points
:
Unit Price - If left blank, the default unit price from the Rate Card Item will be used.
Unit Cost - If left blank, the default unit cost from the Rate Card Item will be used.
Step 2
In the
Rate Card Item
>
Pricing Tier Related
tab, when you click the
New
button, you can add a Pricing Tier Condition to a Rate Card Item.
Each Rate Card Item Pricing Tier Condition includes:
A
Rate Card Item Pricing Tier
ID
An
Attribute Field API Name
for the tier logic (e.g., Duration__c, Quantity__c)
A
Comparison Operator
– '=', '<', '<=', '>', '>=', or 'between'
Value Min
– Enter the value to compare against, and the lower bound if using ‘between’
Value Max
– Required only when using the ‘between’ operator
When a quote is generated or simulated, the correct tiered price is automatically applied based on the conditions met.
If none of the conditions are met, the default standard unit price and unit cost are used.
You can override the unit cost and unit price directly in the Quote grid.
For more information, refer to -
Add Tiered Pricing for Rate Card Items
Ability to Hide Fields on the Add-Ons Grid
As a Provus Admin, you can hide or show columns on the Add-Ons grid, so that you can configure what users can view on the grid.
You can specify visibility for the following fields on the “Quote Ancillaries” component configuration:
Discount %
Quoted Amount
Total Cost
Margin %
For example, you can hide the Quoted Amount (USD) field.
Before configuration:
After Configuration:
For configuration information, refer to -
Control Visibility of Add-Ons Grid Fields
.
Ability to Update Resource Attributes Directly from the Resource Mix Tab
As a Provus user, you can now update the resource attributes directly from the
Resource Mix
tab. Previously, only the resource could be selected, and the system automatically assigned the attributes. This update provides greater control and flexibility in resource configuration.
You can update the attributes of resources from the
Resource Mix
tab or the
View/edit resources
dialogue.
If you update resource attributes in the view/edit resource dialogue, the changes are reflected in the Resource Mix tab after sync.
If you update resource attributes in the Resource Mix tab, the changes are reflected in the view/edit resource dialogue after sync.
Consider the following example, where there are three resources.
Task Resource Mapping
tab:
Resource Mix
tab:
Suppose you change the resource attribute “Skill Level” of one resource on the
View/edit resource
dialog:
The same change is reflected on the
Resource Mix
tab:
Ability to Validate Estimate Template
As a Provus Admin, you can validate and view errors detected in the estimate template, so that you can address issues promptly and ensure resources are aligned correctly.
This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Validate button on Estimate Template
”.
You will see a new
Validate
button on the Estimate template header.
When you click on the Validate button, the following areas are validated:
Tasks
Rate Card
Services
Services Validation
If any services added to the template are inactive, you will see the following error message:
Rate Card Validation
If the linked rate card is inactive or expired on the current date, you will see the following error message:
Task Validation
If a resource is not assigned, effort is empty, or a task parameter is not added to a task, you will see the following error message:
If no issues are found,  you will see the following success message:
Set Default Values for Estimation Input Parameters (Picklist & Tiers)
As an admin, you can define default values for estimation parameters on an estimate template. When a quote is created from that template, these default values are automatically applied to the corresponding parameters in the quote. This ensures consistency and saves time by reducing the need for manual input.
Set Default Values for Tiers Type Scope Parameters
:
You can set the default values for the Tiers type scope parameters. This is behind the beta feature flag -  “
Enable: Default values for Tier Scope Parameters
”.
When you click the
Add Values
icon next to the
Tiers
data type parameter, the
Define default and Add/edit tier values
dialog opens. You see a
Default
number field on the dialog.
When you enter a value in the Default field and save, the system validates that the value entered in the Default field falls into one of the tiers.
If it does not, an inline error appears: "The value entered is not present in tiers."
After the error is resolved and you save, the default value is saved for the estimation parameter.
Set Default Values for Picklist Type Scope Parameters
:
You can set the default values for the Picklist type scope parameters. This is behind the beta feature flag -  “
Enable: Default values for Picklist Scope Parameters
”.
When you click the
Add Values
icon next to the
Picklist
data type parameter, the
Define default and add/edit picklist values
dialog opens. You will see a
Default Value
editable radio field next to each parameter on the dialog.
When you select the radio button for a row, any previously selected row is automatically deselected.
Upon saving, the selected value is saved as the default for the estimation parameter.
To clear the default value, click the
Clear Default
button and save your changes.
If the row marked as default is removed, the
Default Value
column will reflect that no row is currently selected as default.
View Quote Item Price Breakdown
As a Quote Manager, you can now view a detailed breakdown of resource quote item amounts to improve transparency and build confidence in quote accuracy and pricing validity.
This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: New Quote Item Price Breakdown
”.
When you click the Quoted Amount (USD) hyperlink, the Review quote item breakdown page opens with the following details:
Column headers
:
Price Points
Grand Total
<Time Period Group> such as Month 1, Month 2, …
You can expand/collapse Time Period Group headers using +/-. The default is a collapsed view
A sub-header row displays Time Period Group totals when collapsed.
Expanding a Time Period Group reveals weekly breakdowns (e.g., Week 1, Week 2) for periods where allocations exist.
Rows
: Same as the Quote Header Price Breakdown
If you expand the Time Period using +, show all Time Periods under it in which allocation has been done.
Horizontal scrolling is supported when all columns do not fit within the dialog.
Cost and margin fields/rows are hidden for users without the View cost and margin permission.
Usability Enhancements
Enhanced UI for Step 4 of Mass Resource Change
As a Platform sales user, you can now see the mass update resource confirmation dialogue when you make bulk Resource changes for non-estimate based (staffing).
This is available behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Mass Resource Change
”.
When you click the
Mass Change
button on the quote, on the fourth step, the
Confirm resource update
dialog appears with the following tabs:
Records Eligible for Update (N)
Records Not Eligible for Update (N)
If no records are present in any of the tabs, the following message appears:

Release Process

Type of Release
Monthly
New Enhancements
The Provus Services Quoting platform provides the following new enhancements in the May 2025 release:
Functional Enhancements
View Quote Item Breakdown Header Fields
As a Quote Manager, you can now view a detailed breakdown of the resource quote item amount, providing greater transparency into pricing. This helps ensure you and your customers have full confidence in quote accuracy and pricing validity. This is behind
the
beta flag: “
Enable New Quote Item Price Breakdown
”.
When you click the “Quote Amount” hyperlink, you will see the Review quote item breakdown dialog with the following header fields:
Role: Resource Role
Skill Level
Location
Partner Resource
Quote Item Margin%
The Provus admin can configure the header fields through metadata, with a maximum of six fields allowed.
For configuration information, refer to -
Configure Quote Item Breakdown Header Fields
Ability to Configure Quote Grid Fields Sequence
As a Provus admin, you can define the sequence of fields and columns displayed on the quote grid, allowing you to manage and customize the grid view to better suit your business needs.
This feature is behind the feature flag - “
Enables quote grid pricing column sequencing
”.
Using custom metadata on
Quote Configurator
,
Resource Allocation Card
, or
Quote Configurator Card
, you can specify the desired order of columns on the quote grid.
This sequencing capability applies to all standard and custom fields displayed after rate card attributes and before the first allocated cell in the grid.
For more configuration information, refer to -
Configure Quote Grid Fields Sequence
Change Rate Card for Estimate-Based Quotes to One from the Estimate Template
As a Provus user, you can now change the rate card on an Estimate-Based Quote or Scenario to one of the rate cards defined in the associated Estimate Template. This allows you to update pricing for the resource items more accurately.
This feature is behind the beta feature flag - “
Release: Rate Card Change on Estimate Based Quote
”.
On the quote/scenario header, you’ll see a pencil icon next to the rate card field.
On clicking, it opens the Edit quote/scenario dialog with the following fields:
Quote Name
: Read-only
Service Start Date
: Read-only, defaulted from the quote
Description
: Editable
Rate Card
: Editable
In the Rate Card field, you can see the rate cards that have been configured on the Estimate Template as Primary or Secondary, except for the following:
Rate cards that do not belong to the same account as the quote (only Global and quote-specific rate cards are included).
Rate cards that are not marked as Active.
Rate cards that are not active on the quote’s Service Start Date (i.e., the Service Start Date does not fall within the rate card’s Effective Date and Expiration Date).
Note:
If there are no valid secondary rate cards, only the current rate card will be shown.
On saving, the changed rate card and description (if updated) are saved.
If the resource roles in the selected rate card do not match those in the quote, you will see an error message:
If you update only the description, you will see: “
Successfully Updated
” message.
If you update the rate card, you will see a sync message.
If you update both the description and rate card, you will only see the sync message.
After the Rate Card is updated:
The
Base Price
and
Base Cost are
updated based on the new rate card.
If you clone the quote (as a Template, Scenario, or regular Clone), the updated price and cost will be retained.
Any previous price or cost overrides will not be retained.
Note:
Quote-level adjustments like COLA, Contingency, and Total Quoted Amount overrides or discounts are retained.
View Milestone Totals in Milestone Tab
As a Provus user, you can now view the total value of all milestones directly in the Milestone tab, making it easier to understand the overall financial impact at a glance. This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Add Milestone totals
”.
In the Milestones tab, you will see a new field,
Total Milestone Amount
. The field displays the sum of all milestone amounts currently entered in the table.
The Total Milestone Amount is automatically recalculated when you add, edit, or remove any milestone and click
Save
. The total will be updated in real-time to ensure accuracy.
If no milestones are present in the table, the field will display: “Total Milestone Amount: $0.00”
Support for Estimation Parameters(hashtag) in Hyperformula for Quote Grid Fields
As a Provus admin, you can define a formula for calculating values using hashtag parameters. This allows you to establish dynamic formulas based on estimation parameters, so that changes to these parameters do not require a full quote refresh.
You can configure field values on the quote grid using hyperformula, with the following capabilities:
Define hyperformula expressions in Custom Metadata Settings.
Use all mathematical operators and functions supported by hyperformula.
Reference estimation input parameters using hashtags (e.g., #contractterm, #quantity, etc.).
If the formula is evaluated successfully, the calculated values will display automatically in the quote grid based on the logic defined in the metadata.
If the formula contains syntax errors or is invalid, an error will be thrown when the quote is opened.
For configuration information, refer to -
Configure Estimation Parameter (Hashtag) in Hyperformula for Quote Grid Fields
Custom Rate Card field value before using Estimation Input parameter (Hashtag) in formula
:
Parameter value
:
Custom Rate Card field value after using Estimation Input parameter (Hashtag) in formula
:
This configuration applies to both direct quotes and estimate-based quotes.
When you use hashtags in your formulas, the quote does not need to be refreshed for output values to update when the parameter values change.
View Total Labor Amount and Labor Margin % on Quote Header
You can now view the Total Labor Amount and Labor Margin % directly on the quote header, giving you quick visibility into key labor cost metrics.
Two new fields are added to the quote header:
Total Labor Amount
: Displays the sum of all labor prices
Labor Margin %
: Shows the profitability margin for labor. Calculated as (Total Labor Price − Total Labor Cost) / Total Labor Price.
Both values are rounded for display consistency.
The Provus admin can show, hide, or rearrange these fields using metadata settings. For configuration information, refer to
Configure Quote Header Fields
.
Ability to Override/Set Desired Margin % for a Quote
As a Provus user, you can now change the Margin % to adjust the Total Quoted Amount in the Price Adjustments section. This allows you to maintain your required margins more effectively. This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Edit Margin % on Adjust Pricing Dialog”
.
The
Margin %
field in the Adjust Pricing dialog is now editable.
You can enter values up to 2 decimal places, and the margin will be rounded accordingly.
When you change the Margin %, it overrides the
Total Quoted Amount
using the following formula:
Total Quoted Amount = Cost Price / (1 - [Margin % / 100])
.
Upon applying the changes, the system recalculates:
Allocated Discount %
Allocated Discount Amount
A confirmation dialog appears:
Pricing and discounts are recalculated based on the updated Margin %.
The new Margin % is carried over to
Scenarios
,
Cloned Quotes,
and
Quote Templates
.
When the total cost is zero, the Margin % input field is disabled and shows an info icon with the following message:

This section explains how to configure the
default values of the header fields
for
project based services
quotes
so that the sales user does not have to select the fields explicitly.
As a Provus admin user, you can default/configure the following field types shown on the Create Services Quote wizard step 2:
Text Fields:
Description
Date Field:
Service Start Date
Reference Field:
Location
To configure the default value:
In the upper-right corner of the Salesforce Home page, click the gear icon to go to Setup.
On the Setup Home page, enter “custom metadata types” in the Quick Find box, then select
Custom Metadata Types
. The
Custom Metadata Types
page opens and displays a list of all the custom metadata types.
On the Custom Metadata Types page, click the
Manage Records
hyperlink next to the
Provus Component Configuration
label. The
Provus Component Configurations
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configurations page, click the
Edit
hyperlink next to the
Create Service Quote Detail
label. The
Provus Component Configuration (Managed)
page opens.
On the Provus Component Configuration (Managed) page, in the
Json
field, configure the default value using “expression” for any header field and click
Save
. For example, the
Service Start Date
field value is set to the default value referenced from the
Opportunity Close Date
.
In the example below, the Opportunity
Close Date
is 10/7/2020.
When we create a quote from this opportunity using the wizard, the same opportunity close date is referenced in the
Service Start Date
field of step 2 of the wizard.

Provus now provides a read-only access feature, allowing designated users to view, but not edit or delete, quotes within the application. This access is managed through a permission set group called "ReadOnlyUser," which is included in the Provus package.
Additionally, Provus users can view quotes in read-only mode based on the quote's status, such as Pending Approval, Approved, or Rejected.

Provus is natively built on the Salesforce CRM and utilizes the Salesforce opportunity feature to create services quotes. However, customers might sometimes rely on alternative CRMs, such as NetSuite. Despite not using Salesforce, these customers still need Provus’s functionality for generating services quotes. This necessitates finding an equivalent entity to Salesforce's Opportunity within the customer's CRM, such as NetSuite's Opportunity.
This section explains how to create a quote from an external CRM.
To create a quote from external CRM:
On the NetSuite Project page, click the
Create Services Quote
button. This action triggers a URL hit on the Provus side, navigating the user to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Format
: https://<Org_Instance>/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
Parameters like opportunity ID, account ID, and Service Start Date are passed in the URL and stored in corresponding quote fields on the Provus side. This information is used to create a quote in Provus.
Use Case
Suppose you want to generate a quote using Opportunity Id from an external CRM like NetSuite.
On the NetSuite Opportunity/Project page, click the
Create Services Quote
button.
This action triggers a URL (with parameters) hit on the Provus side, navigating to the Salesforce instance where Provus is deployed.
URL Example
:
https://provus-qa-next.lightning.force.com/lightning/n/psq__CreateServicesQuote?c__serviceStartDate=2024-03-01&c__Extoppid=MD44
The
Service Start Date
and
External Opportunity Id
parameters and their values are passed from the external CRM in the above URL.
The Create Services Quote wizard is triggered and the
Create new quote
page opens.
On the Create new quote page, select the
Quote Type
and click
Next
. The wizard displays the service start date passed from the external CRM. Enter the required details and click
Next
.
The
Select services to be included in the quote
page opens.
On the Select services to be included in the quote page, select the required services and click
Next
.
The
Confirm service selection
page opens.
On the Confirm service selection page, check and confirm the selected services and click
Create Quote(s)
.
A new services quote is created from the wizard. The parameter values passed in the URL are stored on the quote fields based on the mapping in settings.
In this use case, the external opportunity id parameter is stored in the text field
External Opportunity Id
on the quote.
Note: For each parameter sent from the external CRM, you can create a custom field on the Provus quote with only the following data types:
Text
Date (Format: YYYY:MM:DD)
Picklist
If a parameter value is modified on the UI during the quote field update, the modified value is stored on the quote field.
A parameter is not stored if it is not present in the setting.
The quote field values are retained when a copy of the quote is created in the following scenarios:
Clone
Make Primary
Scenario
Create a Template and Quote from the template
If multiple quotes are created, the same parameter values are stored on all quotes.
If quote creation fails and an error is presented on the final screen of the create services quote wizard, the parameters remain available for the next attempt to create a quote, without the need for initiation from an external CRM.
An error is generated if a field is not found.
An error is generated if a parameter is not found.

Overview
Scenario modeling in services quotes refers to the process of creating and analyzing different hypothetical situations or variations within a quote for services.
When you are negotiating intricate and competitive large-scale deals, particularly when collaborating with global teams and dealing with extended deal cycles, it becomes critical to generate various what-if scenarios for quotes. These scenarios should be readily available alongside a primary quote, facilitating effective customer negotiations. You can create scenarios for representing fixed prices, time and materials (T&M) rates, location mix variations, and resource mix variations.
Provus provides very sophisticated capabilities for what-if scenario modeling with capabilities such as:
Create what-if scenario from a quote with single click
Compare scenarios side-by-side
Have scenarios to model fixed price, T&M, Location Mix, Resource mix,
Get approvals on multiple scenarios at the same time
Use previously created quotes or scenario as baseline for a new scenario
Easily convert any scenario to a primary quote
Have full estimation, pricing, quoting capabilities in each scenario

Total Quoted Amount Rounding

After applying a percentage discount, the quoted amount may result in a decimal value. In such cases, presenting a rounded-off number to the prospect can prove advantageous.
As a quote manager, you can now adjust or round off the quoted amount to a round number.
To round off the total quoted amount:
Navigate to the
Quote
page and click the
Adjust Pricing
button.
The
View and apply price adjustments
page opens.
On the View and apply price adjustments page, enter the adjusted amount (
Total Quoted Amount)
and click
Apply
.
The price adjustments are applied to the quote.
Rounding Adjustment Calculation
If you override the Total Amount, the discount is applied to the quote items accordingly, ensuring that the quote and quote items amount correctly reflect the adjustment.
On the
Adjust Pricing
dialog, when you edit/override the
Total Quoted Amount
value and apply it:
If there are any existing discounts (quote level, labor discount volume, or labor discount location) already applied, a confirmation message will appear: "
This will remove the already applied discounts. Are you sure you want to continue?
"
If you confirm, then the steps from 2 to 5 are applied.
If you cancel, the
Total Quoted Amount
is reverted to the earlier amount.
All other discounts and existing rounding adjustments (Volume, Location discount, Quote level discount, line item discount/markup) are removed.
Quote level discount is applied as follows:
Allocated Disc %
is calculated as (
Quote Amount (Before Disc)
-
Total Quoted Amount
)/
Quote Amount (Before Disc)
in percentage till 5 decimal value.
Allocated Disc %
is applied to all line items and the Quoted Amount of each line item is calculated with 5 decimal precision.
The Discount Amount
is displayed as the
Aggregated discount amount
of all the quote line items.
The
Rounding Adjustment
is calculated and saved as (
Quote Amount (Before Disc)
-
Discount Amount
) -
Total Quoted Amount
The Rounding adjustment is stored as a Quote item.
Impact on Add-Ons
Add-ons are not considered when applying rounding adjustments and discounts. Consider the following example:
Before Override
:
Total Amount Before Override: 336,000
Total Add-ons Amount: 10,000
Total Labor Amount: 326,000
Here, the add-ons (10,000) are part of the total amount but separate from the labor amount.
After Override
:
Total Amount After Override: 300,000
Add-on Amount (Unchanged): 10,000
Total Labor Amount After Override: 290,000
Discount Percentage Applied: 11.04%
The add-on amount remains unchanged at 10,000 after the override, while the labor amount changes. The discount percentage (11.04%) is applied only to the labor amount (290,000), not to the add-ons.
Target Discount Calculation
:
Target Discount Percentage: 0.1104294479 (or approximately 11.04%)
Labor Amount After Discount: 290,000
The rounding adjustments and discount apply strictly to the labor portion of the total, which excludes the add-ons.

You might want to allow sales users to override the base price for partner resources, as these prices can vary significantly from deal to deal. However, you may not allow sales users to override the base price for FTE resources, since those prices are pre-calculated based on your organization's margin guidelines and need to remain consistent.
As a Provus user, you can disable the base price and base cost override of specific quote items in the quote/add-ons grid.
This section explains how to disable the
Base Price Override
and
Base Cost Override
for selective quote items.
Suppose you want to disable the base cost and base price override for a resource (Tester 24).
To disable base cost and base price override:
On the Home page, navigate to
Rate Cards
.
Click the
Rate Card Name
hyperlink.
The rate card details are displayed.
Navigate to the
Related
tab. The
Rate Card Items
list is displayed.
On the Rate Card Items list, click the hyperlink for the
Rate Card Item
that you want to modify.
The Rate Card Items Details are displayed. You will see two new fields -
Disable Base Price Override
and
Disable Base Cost Override
. By default, these fields are set as "off” (Unchecked).
Click the
Edit
(pencil) icon corresponding to the Disable Base Price Override or Disable Base Cost Override fields. You can now edit the fields.
Select the checkboxes corresponding to the fields that you want to disable and click
Save
. The Base Price and Base Cost are disabled on the quote grid for that rate card item.
If
Disable Base Price Override
and
Disable Base Cost Override
are set as “On” (Checked) then:
You will see the Base Price and Base Cost fields as read-only.
You cannot override the Base Price and Base Cost fields for such quote items.
This setting overrides the custom metadata JSON settings for quote grid columns when the metadata configuration is read-only = false.
If the metadata configuration is read-only = true, the values for “Disable Base Price Override” and “Disable Base Cost Override” are ignored.
This functionality is applicable for both estimate-based and direct quotes.

Base Cost Override on Quote Item
As a sales user, you have the ability to override/adjust the resource cost on the quote item. This allows you to tailor the resource cost according to customer needs.
This feature should be enabled by the beta feature flag "Enable Price and Cost Override."
By default, the
Base Cost
field displays the Rate Card Unit Cost from the quote item.
You can make changes to the Base Cost cell of a quote item:
By double-clicking on the cell to enter edit mode.
By selecting the cell and inputting a value.
The following validation takes place when you click off the cell to exit edit mode and attempt to override the original Base Cost:
If the overridden value is 0, negative, or any other non-numeric character, the value is not saved, and the cell reverts to displaying the original base cost value.
If the Base Cost is not equal to the Rate Card Base Cost, the cell color changes to peach.
If you delete the overridden cell value, the cell value returns to the Rate Card Unit Cost from the rate card.
You also have the capability to modify the overridden cell value to a new value as needed. This functionality applies to all quotes, whether the quote is linked to an estimate or not.
If the Rate Card Base Cost is changed due to rate card updates, the Base Cost will be reset to the updated Rate Card Base Cost, subject to the existing quote status conditions.
Note: Both Base Cost and Base Price override calculations are supported for direct quotes and for quotes from estimates. These calculations are reflected in the quote but not in the quote item breakdown.

Price and Cost Override
Price and cost override in services quotes offer flexibility and adaptability in catering to the diverse needs and circumstances of your clients.
Price and cost override can be useful in several scenarios:
Negotiating Custom Pricing
: When working with a client, you might need to negotiate custom pricing for specific services, especially if the standard pricing doesn't align with their budget or requirements. Price override allows you to offer a tailored price for the quoted services.
Cost Variations
: Cost override can be beneficial when the actual cost of providing a service differs from the standard cost, such as when there are unexpected cost fluctuations or unique resource requirements.
Tiered Pricing
: Some service quotes may involve tiered pricing structures where the price and cost vary based on different service levels or features. Price and cost overrides enable you to customize these tiered structures.
As a sales user, you have the ability to override/adjust the resource cost and price on the quote item.
Base Price Override
: A price override allows you to manually adjust the base price of an item in a quote.
Base Cost Override
: A cost override enables you to manually modify the base cost associated with an item in a quote.

Contingency
Contingency planning involves setting aside resources, such as time, money, or personnel, to address unforeseen events or risks that could impact a project.
Provus provides a fixed bid contingency feature in its pricing engine which provides you with the capability to apply a contingency percentage to a quote to mitigate the risk of exceeding the estimated quote duration for specified resources.
Example
:
Suppose you propose a fixed bid of $1500,000 for the project, including a contingency buffer of 20%. This contingency will help mitigate risks associated with uncertainties in the project's scope. If the project requires additional work beyond the defined scope, the contingency can protect or partially protect against the risk of potential cost overruns.
View and Apply Contingency
To view and apply contingency in your quote:
Navigate to the
Quotes
page and click the
Adjust Pricing
button.
On the View and apply price adjustments page, go to the
Contingency
tab.
On the Contingency tab, you can apply a contingency percentage to your quote.

COLA
COLA refers to a cost adj
ustment mechanism that accounts for changes in the cost of providing the services over time. This adjustment helps ensure the quoted price remains aligned with the evolving cost structure.
Including a COLA provision in your quote acknowledges the potential impact of inflation on the costs associated with delivering the services.
Example
:
Here's an example of how COLA might be applied in a 3-year quote:
Year 1
: Base Amount is $42,000.
Year 2
with 4% COLA applied: $42,000 + ($42,000 x 4%) = $42,000 + ($42,000 x 0.04) = $42,000 + $1,680 = $43,680
Year 3
with 5% COLA applied: $43,680 + ($43,680 x 5%) = $43,680 + ($43,680 x 0.05) = $43,680 + $2,184 = $45,864
So, the Adjusted amounts for Year 2 and Year 3 with COLA applied would be $43,680 and $45,864 respectively.
This example explains how the prices for each year are adjusted based on the COLA factor, ensuring that the pricing reflects the expected increase in the cost of living over the three-year period.
COLA passthrough
Provus pricing capability enables service providers the ability to plan for and adapt to the risks associated with increasing labor costs on multi-year quotes.
When labor costs for your organization increase 8% annually, the Provus system is able to account for these increasing costs in the system by allowing you to apply a Cost of Living A
djustment
(COLA) passthrough rate to adjust revenue to offset increasing costs.
View and Apply COLA
As a Sales Representative, you can view and apply COLA/Inflation Adjustment on the quotes.
Note:
Ensure that the quote is a multi-year quote and cola rates by location are set up and cola is enabled by the admin.
Ensure that the resource location matches the Cola Rates By Location.
You can apply COLA only for the current and the next year.
To view and apply COLA to your quote:
Navigate to the
Quotes
page and click the
Adjust Pricing
button.
The
View and apply price adjustments page opens.
On the View and apply price adjustments page, go to the
COLA
tab.
On the COLA tab, you can include a provision for COLA and Cola Pass% for a multi-year quote.

Markups
Markups refer to the amount added to the cost price of a product or service to determine its selling price. In business and economics, markups play a crucial role in determining profitability and pricing strategy. Markups are typically expressed as a percentage of the cost price, and they are used to cover various expenses and generate a profit for a business.
A
COLA markup
in a quote typically refers to a Cost-of-Living Adjustment markup. This type of markup is often used in contracts or agreements, especially those related to long-term services or products, to account for anticipated increases in costs due to inflation or changes in the cost of living over time.
A
contingency markup
is an additional amount of money added to the cost estimate for a service to account for unforeseen events, risks, or uncertainties that may arise. It acts as a buffer to cover unexpected expenses and mitigate financial risks.

Line item discounts are the discount percentages applied to individual items or products listed on the Quote. Instead of applying a discount to the total purchase amount, line item discounts are itemized, allowing for more targeted and transparent pricing adjustments.
Line item discounts can be inherited from location discounts or quote level discounts. The quote manager can also directly edit them. The line item discount is a key lever that can be used in pricing to help quote managers adjust pricing to win deals while providing control of the magnitude and overall impact of the discount.
Line Item Discounts
:
Inherited Discounts
Inherited discounts are discounts that are applied to the Quote items when price adjustments are made using the Adjust Pricing feature. These discounts are automatically passed down to the individual items on the Quote.
When you are on the Pricing Adjustments tab on a quote and have applied a quote level or location discount for resources, the discount percentage applied will be inherited in the discount percent column on the resource line items.
If you enter a 5% location discount for the United States, then the line item for each resource in the United States will display a line item discount of 5%. The location discount is inherited on the resource line items.
If you enter a quote level discount of 10% for all resources on the quote then a 10% line item discount shall be applied to each line item on the quote.
You have an option to override the inherited discount % value for a given resource line item.

Labor Discounts - By Resource Location
If you are negotiating a quote that involves delivery from multiple locations, it is possible to offer discounts based on the location.
Example 1
:
If there are more resources involved from a particular location, it can be reasonable to offer a higher discount for that location.
4 resources from India - 15% discount
2 resources from the USA - 10% discount
Example 2
:
If it is easier and cheaper to find resources in Charlotte, NC, you can apply a higher discount for that location.
2 resources from San Francisco, CA - 5% discount
2 resources from Dallas, TX - 6% discount
6 resources from Charlotte, NC - 10% discount
The location discount will be applied to all line items where the resources are located.
Negative Discount
You can apply a negative discount based on location using the ‘Labor Disc - By Location’ option in Adjust Pricing.
Quote without Negative Discount
:
Quote with Location-wise Negative Discount applied
:
All the previously applied discounts are removed.
The location discount will be applied to all line items where the resources are located.

Labor Discounts - By Volume
A Volume-Based Labor Discount is a pricing strategy where discounts are applied based on the volume of labor consumed, measured through specific aggregation metrics (like person-periods or labor revenue) and over certain durations (such as quote level, year, quarter, or month). These discounts encourage clients to buy more labor resources by reducing the cost as their consumption increases.
Provus allows you to apply discounts based on the aggregation metric and aggregation duration.
Aggregation Metrics
:
Person Units
: The total efforts in terms of the number of time periods a person works on a project. Common examples include person-months (one consultant working for a month) or person-quarters (one consultant working for a quarter).
Labor Revenue
: The quoted amount for the resources.
Aggregation Duration
:
Quote Level:
Applies to the entire quote for the project or contract.
By Year
: Aggregates the labor volume or revenue over an entire year.
By Quarter
: Aggregates the labor volume or revenue by calendar quarter.
By Month
: Aggregates the labor volume or revenue for each month.
Discount Tiers (Based on Value)
:
The system allows you to apply different discount rates depending on the total amount or volume (person-period or labor revenue) in predefined ranges (tiers). Each tier represents a threshold, and depending on which tier the labor or revenue falls into, the corresponding discount is applied.
Example
:
When Aggregation Metric is: Person Months
Scenario 1
:
Aggregation Duration = Quote Level
The total person-months are calculated across the entire quote.
A single discount tier is applied based on the total person-months.
The same discount percentage is applied to all quote items.
Result
: A single-tier discount is applied to the entire quote.
Scenario 2: Aggregation Duration = By Time Period / By Time Period Group
Person-months are calculated per time period/time period group
A different discount tier can apply to each time period/time period group based on the person-months in that specific period.
Discounts are calculated per time period/time period group, and may vary over time.
Result
: Multi-tier discount is applied based on time period/time period group.
The same logic applies if you select Labor Revenue as the aggregation metric. The aggregation duration still controls how the discount is calculated and applied.
Note:
Mark-up using the negative discount is not supported.

Selecting a Quote level discount enables you to apply a specified discount percentage to the entire quote.
Suppose you enter/edit the
Allocated Disc Amt
.
The
Allocated Disc %
is calculated as (Allocated Disc Amt/Total Amount)*100 up to 5 decimal places.
Discount Applied to the Quote
:
Suppose you enter/edit the
Allocated Disc %
value.
The
Allocated Disc Amt
is calculated as (Allocated Disc %*Total Amount)/100.
Discount applied to the Quote
:
Total Quoted Amt
on the Adjust Pricing dialog header is recalculated as Total Quoted Amt = Total Quote Amt - Allocated Disc Amt.
On Apply, discount value and quote pricing are saved (it will consider it as Total Quoted Amount override).
Note:
Applying the quote-level discount will override any location, volume, and discounts applied to individual quote line items.
No discounts, except for line item discounts, are applied to add-ons.

Businesses often need pricing models that adapt to varying conditions such as quantity, duration, or usage levels. Tiered pricing allows you to define rate card items with multiple tiers based on specific criteria.
For example, you can set different prices depending on the quantity purchased—larger quantities may qualify for lower rates. When the criteria match a defined tier, the corresponding price is automatically applied.
This feature supports more flexible, scalable, and accurate pricing strategies, helping businesses tailor pricing to different customer scenarios and drive better outcomes.
Use Case
:
Consider an example where the
Unit Cost
and
Unit Price
values for the Rate Card Item
Software Architect
are
Unit Price - $6000
Unit Cost - $3000
You want to add a tiered pricing and set a condition for the pricing. For example, a condition can be that if the scope parameter value is greater than 200, then apply the new tiered pricing.
To add tier pricing:
Step 1: Add Rate Card Item Pricing Tier
Navigate to the
Rate Card Item
.
Navigate to the
Related
tab and click
New.
The
New Rate Card Item Pricing Tier
page opens.
On the New Rate Card Item Pricing Tier page, add a
Match Criteria,
set the
Evaluation Priority,
and the
Price Points,
and then click
Save.
Match Criteria
:
All conditions – Acts as an AND operator. All conditions must be met before selecting the price tier.
Any condition – Acts as an OR operator. Based on Evaluation Priority, the system checks if at least one condition matches.
Evaluation Priority – Defines the order in which Pricing Tier Conditions are evaluated. Lower numbers have higher priority.
Note:
If a condition in the evaluation order is inactive, the system should skip it and check the next condition in the sequence.
Price Points
:
Unit Price - If left blank, the default unit price from the Rate Card Item will be used.
Unit Cost - If left blank, the default unit cost from the Rate Card Item will be used.
Step 2: Add Condition to Rate Card Item Pricing Tier
You can now add a condition to the rate card item pricing tier.
To add a condition:
Click the
Rate Card Item Tier
hyperlink.
The
Rate Card Item Pricing Tiers (N)
page opens. N is the number of conditions applied to the tier.
Navigate to the
Related
tab and click
New
.
The
New Rate Card Item Pricing Tier Condition
page opens.
Add a pricing condition to the tier. For example, if the #test (hashtag parameter) value is greater than 200, then apply the tier values.
Each Rate Card Item Pricing Tier Condition includes:
A
Rate Card Item Pricing Tier
ID
An
Attribute Field API Name
for the tier logic (e.g., Duration__c, Quantity__c)
A
Comparison Operator
– '=', '<', '<=', '>', '>=', or 'between'
Value Min
– Enter the value to compare against, and the lower bound if using ‘between’
Value Max
– Required only when using the ‘between’ operator
Estimate Template with this rate card:
The hashtag parameter has picklist values.
#test values:
So, the default value  is 800. The condition for the rate card item pricing tier is that if the #test is greater than 200, then apply the new pricing tier.
When you generate a quote from this estimate, the new values are applied based on the condition.
Note:
When a quote is generated or simulated, the correct tiered price is automatically applied based on the conditions met.
If none of the conditions are met, the default standard unit price and unit cost are used.
You can override the unit cost and unit price directly in the Quote grid.

The Provus admin can create a rate card from a quote and use this rate card to create new quotes for the same customer. This section explains how to create a rate card from a quote.
To create a rate card from a quote:
Navigate to a specific quote page and from the quote actions dropdown, select the Create Rate Card option.
The
Create rate card
dialog opens.
On the Create rate card dialog, enter the
Rate Card Name
,
Effective Date
,
Duplicate Merge Strategy

Expiration Date
, and then click
Create

Overview
You can include additional services or features to enhance the basic offering. These "add-ons" are supplementary items or components that can be appended to the original quote to customize it according to customer-specific needs or preferences.
Some common types of add-ons are:
Airfare
: This add-on includes the cost of air travel.
Mileage
: The mileage add-on covers the cost of fuel, vehicle wear and tear, and other expenses associated with traveling by car.
Meals
: Meal add-on covers the cost of in-flight meals or meals provided by the hotel during their stay. This may include specific dietary preferences or special requests.
Parking
: Parking add-on can cover the cost of parking at the hotel or other designated areas.
Miscellaneous (Misc)
: This category includes any additional expenses that don't fit neatly into other categories.
Car Rental
: This add-on would include the cost of renting a vehicle for the specified duration.
Hotel
: The hotel add-on covers the cost of accommodation during the client's stay.
Add Add-ons
To add add-ons in the quote:
On the
Price
tab, select the
Add-Ons Pricing
subtab tab.
Enter the add-on details in the respective fields.
Add-Ons Pricing
Frequency
: This refers to how often the addons will be utilized or billed. It establishes the billing schedule or usage pattern for the addons.
The frequency options include:
Custom
: Billing occurs on a schedule tailored to the specific needs of the customer.
Project End
: Addons are utilized or billed at the conclusion of a project.
Project Start
: Addons are utilized or billed at the beginning of a project.
Quarterly
: Addons are billed or utilized every three months.
Yearly
: Addons are billed or utilized annually.
Price Method
: This defines the method used to calculate the prices of the addons. Different methods can be employed depending on the nature of the add-ons and the business model.
The price methods include:
% of Revenue:
The addon price is a percentage of the labor revenue. For instance, with a 10% rate on $1,000 revenue, the customer pays $100 extra.
Flat Price:
A fixed price is set for the add-on, unaffected by factors like revenue or usage. For example, a $50 addon will always cost $50.
Per Head:
Pricing is based on the number of users or participants. If set at $10 per user, 5 users would result in a $50 charge.
Per Occurrence
: The addon price is determined each time a specific event or action occurs. For example, if the price is $20 per occurrence, and the event happens 3 times, the customer would pay $60 for the addons.
Quantity per Occurrence (read-only by default, conditionally editable):
This refers to the number of times an add-on is applied or used during a single occurrence of a specific event or action. By default, this field cannot be edited, but it becomes editable under certain conditions, such as when the "Price Method" is set to "Per Occurrence."
Total Quantity (read-only):
This represents the cumulative number of times the add-on is used across all occurrences. It provides an overall total and remains read-only, meaning it cannot be modified directly.
Price Method % (Percentage)
: If the price method chosen is a percentage of something (e.g., revenue), this field specifies the exact percentage used in the calculation. For example, if addons are priced at 5% of the customer's total revenue, the "Price Method %" would be 5%.
Base Price
: This is the starting or baseline price before any addons are included. It represents the cost or price of the core product or service without any additional features.
Margin % (Profit Margin Percentage)
: This is an optional field that allows you to calculate the profit margin for the add-ons. To determine the profit margin, you consider the cost of providing the addons and the desired profit. The profit margin percentage is calculated as (Profit / Cost) x 100. It helps ensure that the addons are priced in a way that covers costs and generates the desired level of profit.
Add-Ons Discount
Discount %
: If there are any discounts applicable to the addons, specify the discount percentage.
Quoted Amount
: The calculated amount for the addons after applying the pricing method and any discounts.
Example
:
Let's assume you have an add-on service called "Custom Reporting" with a quoted amount of $500. You want to offer a 15% discount on this add-on.
Discount Percentage
: 15%
Quoted Amount for "Custom Reporting" add-on: $500
To calculate the discounted amount for the "Custom Reporting" add-on, you can apply the discount percentage:
Discounted Amount = Quoted Amount - (Quoted Amount * Discount Percentage)
= $500 - ($500 * 0.15)
= $500 - $75
= $425
So, after applying the 15% discount, the quoted amount for the "Custom Reporting" add-on would be $425.
Add-Ons Totals
Total Cost
: The sum of the base price and the quoted amount for the addons.
Total Amount
: The final total including the base price, add-ons, and any applicable discounts or margins.
Note:
When periods are added using 'Add Periods' from Resource Allocation, the add-ons grid shows the newly added periods automatically (without refresh).
When add-ons are added/modified/removed from Quote Summary, the change is reflected on the Add-ons tab without refreshing and vice versa.
Add-Ons Pricing Illustration
Mass Add Add-Ons
As a sales user, you can select multiple add-ons and add those in bulk. This functionality is available behind the beta flag - “
Release: Mass add add-ons
.”
You will see a new
Add Add-Ons
button on the Add-Ons grid (Add-Ons tab and Add-Ons section of the Quote summary).
Add-Ons
section on the
Quote Summary
:
Add-Ons Pricing
subtab under the
Price
tab:
When you click the Add add-ons button, the
Add add-ons
dialog opens. The Add add-ons dialog displays the list of all add-ons along with the
Add-Ons Category
(Product Family of the Add-Ons).
You can select one or more add-ons using the checkboxes. After selection or de-selection, the text "Select add-ons to be included in the quote (<count> selected)" is updated with the count of the add-ons selected.
When you save, the selected add-ons are added to the add-ons grid. The Provus admin can hide the button based on the persona using the custom permission
Quote Tab: Mass Add Add-ons
. Additionally, the ability to add add-ons inline is removed.

As a Provus user, you can see the increased height of the quote grid components so that you get more space to work on the quote grid. This is behind the beta feature flag - “
Enable: Increase height of the quote grid components.
”
The Provus admin can set the height of the component using the number of rows including total rows and sections for Resource Allocation and Labor Pricing cards/tab. If the number of rows exceeds the component height, you will see a vertical scroll bar inside the quote grid.
For more information on configuration, refer to -

This section explains how to add/delete/edit sections on the quote grid.
Add New Section
To add a new section:
In the
Resource Allocation
card or
Price
tab,  right-click in the last row of the section.
Select the
Add section
option from the menu. The
Create Section
page opens.
On the Create Section page, enter the new section name and click the
Create Section
button.
The new section is added below the previous one.
Create Duplicate Section
As a Provus user, you can add a duplicate section for the direct quotes so that you can quickly create a resource item in the quote grid.  This feature is behind the beta flag “
Release: Direct Quote - Duplicate a Section.
”
This section explains how to create a duplicate section.
Suppose you have a section called “Development Phase 1” and you want to create a duplicate section.
To create a duplicate section:
In the
Resource Allocation
card or
Price
tab of a direct quote, right-click on a section.
In the menu options, you see a new menu named
Duplicate Section
.
Click the
Duplicate Section
option from the menu. The Duplicate section dialog opens.
In the Duplicate section dialog, enter a name for the new section and click the
Duplicate section
button.
A new section with the given name is created along with the same resource quote items as present in the original section.
The entire quote item information, including quote item discount, price/cost override, resource name (including renamed resource), and resource allocation, is copied into the new section.
The newly added section gets added after the current section in the Resource Allocation card, Price card, and Price tab.
The sequence number of the new section is incremented by 1 compared to the current section.
The sequence number of all subsequent sections is adjusted so that there is an increment of 1.
Once a section is added, repricing is done to update the total amount/cost considering contingency, COLA, and any applied discounts.
Note: If you duplicate a section with quote item custom fields, the custom field values are not copied.
Remove Section
In the
Resource Allocation
card or
Price
tab of a direct quote, right-click on an empty section (with no resources).
Select the
Remove section
option from the menu. (You can see this option only when the section is empty).
If the section is not empty, you will see an error message: "Unable to remove section. Please remove all child resources before deleting the section."
If the section is a default section, you will see an error message: "Default section cannot be removed."
If the section is empty and not the default section then the section is removed from the quote.

The "Mass Effort Update" button will not be visible on the Resource Allocation Grid and Price tab.
Highlighted resource rows will be in read-only mode. You will not be able to override prices/costs or update allocations in time periods for these rows.
The add-ons grid will be in read-only mode for highlighted rows.
You will be able to right-click to Remove Add-on for highlighted add-ons.
The option to Make Non-billable will be in read-only mode.
If You Remove/edit resources and remove Add-ons that do not belong to the new rate card, you will see the following changes:
All Provus actions will be visible.
Additional Details link will be visible.
All right-click options on resource quote items and add-ons will become available.
Mass effort update action will be visible once highlighting on all resource quote items is removed.
When a non-matching resource is replaced using Edit resource, then comment, quote level discount/adjustment, and quote item discount are retained.

Read Only Users
Provus now offers a read-only access capability, allowing certain users to view but not edit or delete quotes within the application. This feature is ideal for users who need to monitor quotes without making changes, ensuring data integrity and security.
This access is controlled through a permission set group called "
ReadOnlyUser
," which is included in the Provus package.
The "ReadOnlyUser" permission set group includes the following permission sets:
View Estimates
View Estimate Templates
View Proposals
View Quotes
Quotes from Estimate Template
The following tabs of the Estimate based quote are configured as read-only through the
ReadOnlyUser
permission set group:
Quote Summary
Price Tab
Scope Tab
Effort Tab
Resources Tab
Summary Tab
The following table represents the read-only configuration for the Estimate-based quote tabs, along with the associated permissions and restriction:

Assign Resources to Tasks
You can assign resources to a custom task from WBS so that you can modify effort per resource for the task.
To assign resources to a custom or standard task:
Navigate to the
Resource
column of the Work Breakdown Structure subtab under the Scope tab.
If no resource is assigned to a custom or standard task, then you see the
Assign Resources
hyperlink against the task with a warning icon and a hover-over message instructing you to define resource and effort allocation.
Click the
Assign Resources
hyperlink corresponding to the task name. The
View/edit resources
dialog opens. If no resource is assigned to a custom or standard task, the dialog is displayed as blank.
On the View/edit dialog, enter the
Resource Role
,
Effort (%),
and,
Effort (hrs)
and click
Save
.
On the
Task Resource Mapping
subtab under the
Resources
tab, you can see the custom or standard task updated with the assigned resource role(s). You can also see the assigned resources updated in the quote grid in Labor Pricing, Quote Summary, and Summaries with allocated effort and pricing (synced to quote).
Allocate Effort to Resources
You can allocate efforts to resources on the
View/edit resources
dialog.
To allocate Effort to the resources:
On the Work Breakdown Structure subtab under the Scope tab, click the
Resource Role
name or
<count> Resources
hyperlink against the custom task.
The
View/edit resources
dialog opens.
On the View/edit resources dialog, enter the
Effort (%) or Effort (Hrs)
for each resource and click
Save
.
The resource Module Manager will work on the “Prep” task for 50 hours and the total task effort is 50 hours. So, the Effort (%) for that resource is 100%.
You can split the Effort (%) between multiple resources, but the total of Effort (Hrs) must match the total task effort.
If the Total of
Effort (hrs)
does not match Total Task Effort, you will see an error message: 'Total must be <Total Task Effort>'.
Note:
Both Effort (hrs) and Effort (%) are editable, rounded to 2 decimal places.
If Effort (%) is changed, Effort (hrs) is calculated as:
Effort (hrs) = (Effort (%) * Total Task Effort) / 100
If Effort (hrs) is changed, Effort (%) is calculated as:
Effort (%) = (Effort (hrs) / Total Task Effort) * 100
Total of Effort (%) = (Total Effort (hrs) / Total Task Effort) * 100

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) within the Provus quoting tool is organized as a tree structure with different levels of detail.
Here's a breakdown of each level:
Services
: These are the highest level of categorization in the WBS. Services represent the major deliverables or outcomes of the project. For example, in a software development project, services could include "Frontend Development," "Backend Development," and "Testing."
Activity Groups
: Below the services, you have activity groups. These are sub-categories that break down the services into more manageable components. Continuing with the software development example, under "Frontend Development," you might have activity groups like "UI Design," "Feature Development," and "Integration."
Activities
: Activities are the specific tasks or work packages within each activity group. They further break down the work into actionable items. For "Feature Development" under "Frontend Development," activities could include "Implement Login Page," "Create User Profile Page," etc.
Tasks
: Tasks are the lowest level of detail in the WBS. They represent the smallest units of work that can be assigned to individuals or teams. Tasks are often the level at which resources are assigned and effort is estimated. For example, a task could be "Write code for Login Page."
On the WBS, you can assign resources to both standard tasks and custom tasks. You can also allocate effort at the task level, specifying how much time or resources are required to complete each task. Additionally, you can edit the effort estimates for tasks to reflect changes in project requirements or scope.
